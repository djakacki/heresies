				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>Clients are the catalysts of architec-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>ture; they enable the architect&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>thoughts on paper to exist in three
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>dimensions, and they may often
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>play a creative role in the design process.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>Yet the crucial relationship between de-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>signer and client and the manner in which
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>an architect receives a commission have
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>largely been kept in the wings of architec-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>tural history. In the case of women archi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>tects and designers this relationship is of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>particular complexity. For women, entrée
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>into traditional centers of power and in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>fluence, in an economic and political sense
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>—the milieus that afford the contacts
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>which develop clients—is largely closed.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>An examination of the clients of Julia
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>Morgan, the most prolific independent
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>woman architect in American architectur¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>al history, provides an understanding of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>how a woman functioned as a profession¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>al within the restrictions inherent in being
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>a woman before World War II. Approxi-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>mately half of Morgan&apos;s clients were
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>women or institutions for women. She
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>determinedly avoided publicity and self-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>promotion. Most of her important clients
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>developed not as a result of accounts of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>her work in popular and professional jour¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>nals but from social connections and rec¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>ommendations from former clients and a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>network of both women of wealth and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>women professionals of more modest
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>economic means.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>In 1902, after completing a first degree
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>at Berkeley in engineering, Julia Morgan
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>completed a course in the section of archi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>tecture at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>Paris. She was the first woman in the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>school&apos;s history to be accepted for this
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>course. For 40 years she headed her own
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>architectural firm in San Francisco, and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>when she died at age 85 in 1957 she had
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>designed some 700 buildings. She de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>signed within an eclectic vocabulary,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>drawing on both the academic Beaux-Arts
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>and traditional California vernacular ar¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>chitecture for inspiration. She practiced in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>this mode with close attention to the de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>sires of her clients and to sound construc¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>tion. Many of her commissions were the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>result of earlier ones for the same clients.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l53' n='N053'/>From the beginning of her career, Julia
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l54' n='N054'/>Morgan was encouraged by women. Mor¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l55' n='N055'/>gan&apos;s very first client, while she was still
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l56' n='N056'/>in Paris at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, was
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l57' n='N057'/>Mrs. Harriet Fearing, an expatriate from
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>Julia Morgan.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>New York and Newport. Fearing asked
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>Morgan to add a grand salon to her 17th-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>century house in Fontainebleau, where she
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>could present musicales and exhibitions
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>by her young protegées in the arts. The
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>room was built in 1902 and was used as it
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>had been intended until at least the middle
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>of World War I, when Mrs. Fearing had to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>return temporarily to Newport. The speci¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>fications, including bills from masons,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>chimney-builders, locksmiths, and orna¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>mental plasterers—all addressed to &quot;Mlle.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>Morgan, Architecte&quot;—were saved with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>her Beaux-Arts drawings and are in the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>Documents Collection at Berkeley.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>Shortly after her return to California
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>Morgan managed to set up her own office
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>in San Francisco. Her first major building
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>project was the Mills College Campanil of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>1903-1904, the first college bell tower in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>the West. Susan Mills, the president (and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l22' n='N022'/>co-founder) of this college for women,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l23' n='N023'/>found a benefactor for the project in Frank
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l24' n='N024'/>Smith, the husband of one of her trustees.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l25' n='N025'/>Undoubtedly Mrs. Mills liked the idea of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l26' n='N026'/>an Oakland woman being the architect in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l27' n='N027'/>charge of the project, but Mr. Smith
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l28' n='N028'/>listened to the complaints of the contract¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l29' n='N029'/>or, Bernard Ransome, who did not believe
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l30' n='N030'/>any young lady could understand rein-
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l1' n='N001'/>forced concrete. Yet the tower withstood
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l2' n='N002'/>the earthquake of 1906. After quite a con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l3' n='N003'/>troversy, which almost makes it seem
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l4' n='N004'/>that Smith rather than Mills was the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l5' n='N005'/>client, the completed tower was dedi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l6' n='N006'/>cated, with Ransome&apos;s name ahead of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l7' n='N007'/>Morgan&apos;s in the program. (The plaque on
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l8' n='N008'/>the tower said: &quot;Erected by Mr. and Mrs.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l9' n='N009'/>Frank Smith.“) The Mills commission
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>brought others. Susan Mills commissioned
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l11' n='N011'/>Morgan to do the library, the gymnasium,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l12' n='N012'/>the social hall, and the infirmary at the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l13' n='N013'/>college, while Mr. Smith hired her to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l14' n='N014'/>build a large &quot;cottage&quot; as a refuge for
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l15' n='N015'/>young women in whom his wife took a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l16' n='N016'/>charitable interest.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l17' n='N017'/>Among Morgan&apos;s significant clients,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l18' n='N018'/>Phoebe Apperson Hearst was one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l19' n='N019'/>earliest. The connection with Mrs. Hearst
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l20' n='N020'/>was vital to Morgan&apos;s career. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l21' n='N021'/>through Mrs. Hearst that Morgan became
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l22' n='N022'/>the &quot;house&quot; architect for western YWCAs.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l23' n='N023'/>Phoebe Hearst&apos;s example led to the com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l24' n='N024'/>misson for San Simeon, the William
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l25' n='N025'/>Randolph Hearst estate, which in turn led
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l26' n='N026'/>to an association with Marion Davies, the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l27' n='N027'/>presiding hostess at San Simeon, who
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l28' n='N028'/>later commissioned important works from
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l29' n='N029'/>Morgan.

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>Morgan&apos;s involvement with Mrs.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>Hearst began in her student days at the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>Ecole des Beaux-Arts. Mrs. Hearst pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>vided stipends for all California students
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>at the Ecole. In Paris Morgan had an
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>apartment in the same house as Bernard
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>Maybeck, who designed Hearst Hall for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>the University of California. This was first
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>used as a reception pavilion for Mrs.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>Hearst&apos;s Berkeley house and later moved
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>to the university. Morgan worked on
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>some of the drawings for Hearst Hall. In
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>1910 Mrs. Hearst, or &quot;the Empress&quot; as she
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>was called in certain circles in San Fran¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>cisco, commissioned Morgan to enlarge
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>and embellish her home The Hacienda“
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>in Pleasanton. The house became a social
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>center for entertaining not just the family
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>and personal friends, but beneficiaries of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>the various good works promoted by
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>Mrs. Hearst. This included especially the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>women students of Berkeley and workers
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>in the YWCA movement all over the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>West. The Hearst connection is obviously
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>the key to understanding how Julia Mor-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>gan obtained her most important institu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>tional client, the YWCA.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>The Pacific Coast Field Committee of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>the National Y had conferred annually
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>since 1900 at the old Hotel Capitola near
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>the beach at Santa Cruz. When the hotel
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>was destroyed by fire in 1912, Phoebe
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>Hearst invited the conference to &quot;The
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>Hacienda,&quot; where she had a tent city
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>erected on the grounds, with facilities for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>300 (including 300 pairs of rubbers and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>300 umbrellas when a rainstorm came
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>up). The camp equipment became the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>basic furniture for the conference grounds,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>established the next year in Pacific Grove.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>Here a tract of 30 acres along the ocean
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>was given to the YWCA by the Pacific Im¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>provement Company, with the stipula¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>tion that improvements worth 530,000 be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>made within 10 years. This became Asilo¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>mar (refuge by the sea). Mrs. Hearst pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>vided funds for the first Assembly Hall,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>now the Hearst Administration Building.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>The architect to plan and supervise the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>whole enterprise (built throughout the

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>Between 1913 and 1915, she was also
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>engaged in constructing large urban
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>YWCAs in Oakland and San Jose, only
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>the first of many Ys Morgan would de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>sign. Commissions for those two struc¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>tures may have come at least in part from
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>the influence of Morgan&apos;s sorority sister
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>Grace Fisher, who was a YWCA board
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>member. Julia Morgan wrote to Phoebe
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>Hearst in 1919, saying how much she ap¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>preciated what had grown out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>General Plan“ of Asilomar—the relation¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>ship with the New York National YWCA
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>Board, and in fact the offer to work there
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>permanently to oversee building plans
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>nationally (which she did not undertake).

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>The YWCA work naturally brought

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>on Lombard Street in 1935. Elsa Schilling,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>also a member of the residence board, had
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>Morgan build a Lake Tahoe house for her

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>died.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>Morgan&apos;s work at Mills College also
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>brought her new and important commis¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>sions. Dr. Mariana Bertola had been the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>college physician at Mills when Morgan
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>was engaged in building there. Immedi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>ately after the earthquake, when Dr.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>Bertola&apos;s house and office were destroyed
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>by fire, she commissioned a new set of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>two buildings, one for offices and one for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>her residence on Jackson Street in San
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>Francisco. These still stand, converted to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>apartments. Dr. Bertola&apos;s role as a client
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>became more significant as she herself
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>took on expanding leadership in the city.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>witnessed the growth of important wom¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>Morgan was often chosen as the designer
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>for California women&apos;s clubs. Morgan de¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>to have served as a client, since each local
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>group was well under way and usually in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>a clubhouse before affiliation with the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>federation took place. At any rate, the

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>1907 chose a building committee which
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>asked Morgan for plans in 1914. The local

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>for 5150,000 in the ’70s. The chairman of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>the building committee of the Minerva
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>Club in Santa Maria had lived in Berkeley,

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>as the architect for the new building. In
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>Sausalito in 1918 the Women&apos;s Club met
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>with some skepticism from fathers and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>brothers who heard of their choice of a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>woman architect. One concerned husband
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>eft a trust fund for repairs for this club
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>which he believed would inevitably fall

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>in the state. This they secured in the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>Berkeley Women&apos;s City Club (now co¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>educational), a castlelike six-story struc¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>large daylighted swimming pool and flex-

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>Institutions for the education of wom¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>secondary schools she designed include
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>the Barnard School in Berkeley, Ransom

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>Many of her domestic commissions
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>also came from women. Mrs. Elsie Drex¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>San Francisco Directory, commissioned a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>redwood residence with pergolas, in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>Woodside; it is still one of the great
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>houses of the Peninsula area. Mrs. Liver¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l52' n='N052'/>more of Livermore had Morgan build her
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l53' n='N053'/>a small house in the country and another

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l55' n='N055'/>the Willis Polk house at the crest. In 1916,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l56' n='N056'/>when materials were scarce, the architect
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l57' n='N057'/>used windows salvaged from the Panama¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l58' n='N058'/>Pacific Exposition, and the house for Mrs.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l63' n='N063'/>senses. Mrs. Starr, whose family had two

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l9' n='N009'/>aerie in Los Gatos. Mrs. David Gamble
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>was the head of the building committee
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l11' n='N011'/>for the Pasadena YWCA. Mrs. Cecil B.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l26' n='N026'/>to the rear where the view of the bay is

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l32' n='N032'/>a retirement cottage on the hill overlook¬

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>another architect. She did.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>Social connections and past clients as
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>the key to commissions is not a phenom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>enon particular to women. What is un¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>usual is that it is unlikely that any male
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>would have a roster of clients that was 50
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>percent institutions for women or women
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>commissioning domestic buildings. This is
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>as revealing about women architects and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>Morgan as it is about women themselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>These women&apos;s institutions and the wom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>en clients had a consciousness about their
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>womanhood and about the support of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>other women that led them to patronize a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>woman when a qualified woman was
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>available. It was in large part because of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>this that Morgan was able to execute so
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>many buildings.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>Julia Morgan is not well known even
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>among those interested in architecture.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>There are many reasons for this. She
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>shunned publicity, her work was designed
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>in an eclectic mode which 20th-century
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>historians are just beginning to appreci¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>ate, and lastly it is possible that, as much
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>of her work was done for women, it may
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>have been ignored as out of the main¬
