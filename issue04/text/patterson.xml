               The island women love to talk but
               they seldom talk in aesthetic terms
               about the houses which are their medi-
               um and arena for a lifetime. They talk
               maliciously, sentimentally, tartly, and
               vividly about people, animals, crops,
               and weather, things that move and
               change. “Hasn’t he a God-forsaken ap-
               pearance?”“Nothing for it now but to               
               put the thought of the evil day on the
               “You have two firm little
               long finger.
               ankle bones that’Il walk you there and
               back again.” Animated and daring
               while describing any event, living in-
               tensely inside their all-purpose kitchen,
               the chameleon like hub of Aran life,
               which changes constantly with each
               chore, meal and ceremony, Kate Con-
               neeley and Nan Mullin treat their
               kitchens like their worn clothes, as
               things to be taken for granted. But the
               two crafts executed by Aran women,
               interior design and knitting, are
               decidedly legitimate art forms, each
               with its aesthetic devices, which could
               not have been developed anywhere ex-
               cept on this slab of rock twelve miles
               out in the Atlantic.
               The Aran house, thatched or slate
               roofed, stands straight up on top of
               sheets of dark gray limestone with
               nothing, no flower borders or architec-
               tural fancies, to soften the abruptness</p>
            <p>
               of its construction. Inside it is mostly a
               kitchen with some adjunct rooms on the
               side for sleeping and storage. This ver-
               satile kitchen exists in marked contrast
               to the raw, for the most part untouched
               rock and soil outside. Within is a world
               of absorbing chores, but there is noth-
               ing at all cozy or domestic about the
               awesome views through the windows or
               open door in Aran. It’s customary in
               this windy place to leave one of the two
               facing kitchen doors open all day for
               light. Shifts in the wind dictate which
               of the two it’s to be. A glance outside
               Nan Mullin’s east-facing kitchen door
               reveals the mountainous Connemara
               coast, a vaulting sky with a drama of
               gargantuan clouds. If a strong wind
               came against it, this door would be shut
               fast, its west-facing twin would be
               opened, and all the daily traffic habits
               would be reversed. The cliff-side view
               is almost Martian in its desolate, ter-
               raced expanse of limestone walls,
               cheered only by “those cheeky devils,
               the foraging chickens in Nan s yard.
               The less affluent houses on the re-
               mote wester tip of Inishmore (largest
               of the three islands that sit at the mouth
               of Galway Bay on the Atlantic coast of
               Ireland) are structurally simple and
               straightforward with little if any mold-
               ing or refined carpentry. The rooms</p>
            <p>
               have thick plaster or mud-covered
               walls, which are divided into upper and
               lower halves of differing colors by a
               border, a strip of patterned paper. One
               of the visual pleasures of these kitchens
               lies in the eccentric deployment of er-
               ratic quantities of paint. A dish cabinet
               or a door is painted from the same can
               of bright enameled paint as a small
               frame around a religious picture. The
               paint used to define a three-dimension-
               al object may show up as a flat band
               around a deep-silled window. The
               movement of the colors—heavy and
               bright worked against luminous white-
               wash—compensates for the minimal
               skills in carpentry and masonry. The
               unpredictable color patches create a
               liveliness and variety in a house made
               up of white and two colors. But what
               colors! A kelly green and a chrome yel-
               low, used in equal amounts. This kin-
               etic, frugal paint scheme keeps the eye
               moving. When a paint can is opened,
               any object that looks woebegone re-
               ceives a fresh coat. It’s an anarchistic
               way to paint. Shelves made of card-
               board receive the same irreverent, care-
               free enameling used on a door. The
               general effect is that paint equals fresh-
               ening.

               paint and whitewash brush would not</p>

               be likely to win a home arts competi-
               tion. Most of the items she uses to dec
               orate her home are 80-cent purchases:
               plaster statuettes of the Virgin Mary or
               quickly put together cardboard shelves.
               nothing to compare with the hand
               painted wonders of the Pennsylvania
               Dutch. But the placement of these
               store-bought objects throughout the
               room is witty and innately elegant.
               Rooms dominated by a vivacity of lan
               guage and dramatic physical gestures
               pick up sparkle from the stray spots of
               decoration, the luminous white walls,
               and the vivid shifting of wall levels. Ex-
               cept for the religious items, everything
               in the room is intensely handled: buck-
               ets, kettles and dishes. There is a nat-
               ural flow between room decor and peo-
               ple. Objects with multiple uses seem fit-
               ting for a talkative people with a variety
               of skills. The stove is used for warming
               the room, washing and drying clothes,
               and cooking.
               The Aran people either emigrate or
               stay put—nothing else. Life is con-
               trolled by specific facts of nature and
               history. The lack of trees, the phenom-
               enal wind and rain, and the astonishing
               contiguity of the swarming, changeful
               life in the homes exist side by side with
               the somber Celtic and Christian debris
               (prehistoric forts, beehive dwellings of
               the saints, and Celtic crosses). Every-
               thing goes on within a cultural-psychic
               frame. Just as life is lived within rigor-
               ous structures—of a subsistence econo-
               my, Catholicism, no big city distrac-
               tions, no birth control, no divorce—the
               frames are the motif everywhere. It is</p>
            <p>
               an island framed by water, framed by
               the Gaelic language; the mantel frames
               the coal stove or the hearth and is itself
               framed by a march of mementos and
               photos across its top.
               Not even Mondrian lived more with-
               in rectilinear plasticity than the woman
               who boils, bakes, mends, churns.
               washes, sweeps, skims and spiffs up her
               gridded workroom. The frame is used
               mostly as a definer, signifying “this is a
               door, this is the cupboard, setting off
               religious chromos with an inexpensive
               wooden frame. The placements, choice
               of objects, designing of the frame never
               seem off-handed, although the spatial
               judgements are never as precise as
               those made by the Shakers. Much of
               the architectural play is achieved by
               hanging frames at various levels, set-
               ting up a rhythm of unpredictable un-
               ions and divisions. There are three
               basic conventions for hanging pictures.
               The first is to hang the largest, always
               Jesus or Mary, about six inches from
               the ceiling, its top edge angled out from
               the wall. The second is to arrange
               groups in relation to the patterned di-
               vider which circles the room. The third
               convention relates objects to the doors
               and windows. A framed prayer, sus-
               pended by a string smack in the center
               above the door, does double duty,
               blessing the house and welcoming the
               visitor. None of the objects is placed
               only for decorative effect: these pres-
               ences are like protectors spotted around
               .. . or connections. They create a stage
               set of cultural locators, defining the

               eage as either Hernon, O’Brian or Con-
               cannon.
               The most baroque object in any kit-
               chen is the dish cabinet with virtually
               every piece of dishware owned by the

               hanging spots and pattern changes.

               Virgin Mary, the Infant of Prague,
               small porcelain roosters, windup clock,
               battery-run radio, official portraiture:
               John F. Kennedy, Padriac Pearse (the
               Irish nationalist and poet), at least one
               pope, Pius, John or Paul, or St. Martin
               de Porres, a black saint who is a pop-
               ular favorite all over Ireland.
               The baroque condition of the mantel
               top and dish cabinet emphasizes the
               tendency of Aran rooms to throw all
               items into sculptural relief. The small-
               est item, a minute frame with a baby
               photo, a tiny white plastic statue of
               Mary, are tactically transformed by
               framing, color and placement, so that
               each item is emphatically present, a
               strongly defined object. The foot-and-
               a-half thick walls contribute a massive-
               ness that is echoed by other hard-edge
               devices, the space divisions created by
               the borders are made more dramatic by
               the interplay of the cool luminous
               whitewash and the glossiness and hard
               insistence of the thick, brilliant, full-
               strength enamel.</p>

               Some of the most enticing designs oc-
               cur along the room’s equator, an inch-
               and-a-half wall divider, a strip of paper
               with a flower pattern. Teasingly de-
               ployed with themselves and with the
               border are a potpourri of small articles:
               ceramic mementos, calendars, post
               cards, sentimental homilies and illus-
               trated prayers. A souvenir plate just
               nudges the edge of a door frame, while
               its other side touches a prayer card
               which sits an inch above the patterned
               divider. These small gifts work as
               touchstones to the culture, but their
               minute echoing and alteration, one
               against the other, is endlessly enticing
               to the mind and eye.
               While the Aran women may take
               their work as interior decorators for
               granted, they are proud, byedad!, of
               their sweaters and well aware of the art
               involved in making them. Sculptural
               (with a surface level varying as much as
               an inch), monochromatic and tight-fit-
               ting, these encrusted sweaters are
               meant to be worn in a harsh climate.
               Textures are coarse like the fissured
               and gashed surface of the island. Made
               of wool from which the natural oil has
               not been removed they’re close to
               waterproof. They are so tight that they
               have buttons at the neck so that the
               head can get comfortably through. The
               close fit cuts down the possibilities of
               entanglement and interference, allow-
               ing it to be easily worn under a worker’s
               jacket.
               The patterns are arranged into clear
               representations of the island’s physical
               terrain, with its staggering number of
               stone walls enclosing myriad tiny fields.

            <p>
               cross the rocky island. Imagine a verti-
               cal row of diamonds enclosing a field of
               seed stitches with a bobble inside each
               of the diamond points, every diamond
               framed on its side by a band of cable
               stitches.
               The sweaters are always a single col-
               or, usually a dark tweedy gray, indigo
               black or subtle browns with moss green
               or maroon casts to them. They possess
               an intriguing tone . . . nutty colors, like
               dark cinnamon or the shells of Brazil
               nuts. The women dress against the
               dourness of the island in bright primary
               colors, floral-print cottons and plaids;
               the men wear the colors of the land-
               scape, brindled gray pants and sweat-
               ers, dark browns and dark blues, which
               harmonize with the stone walls, the
               fields, the sweep of limestone.
               The names of the stitches and pat-
               terns refer to the trade of the men who
               originally wore them: the cable, rope.
               ladder stitch, the herring bone, triple
               sea wave, lobster claw, fish tail. These
               explicit names are different from the
               lyrical ones still used in Scotland, such
               as Sacred Heart, the Rose of Sharon,
               Star of Hope, Crown of Glory. But the
               Aran fisherman’s sweater has its own
               biblical stitch, the Tree of Life. Orig
               inally, the sweaters were made by fish-
               ermen, a rather natural step from mak-
               ing and mending nets, weaving ropes
               and making knots. Now, and for an un-
               determined length of time, the women
               have taken over.
               One of the finest knitters is Una Fla-
               herty, a Bohemian spirit, her clothes
               held on by safety pins, who runs the
               shop in Bongowla, the last village on
               the western tip of the island. In be-
               tween chasing chickens out of the open
               door, receiving a new shipment of
               goods from Galway with high-spirited
               witticisms and sarcastically getting tea
               for her husband Patrick, she knits. She
               has an energetic way with her works in
               progress, dragging them along the floor
               after her as she goes in search of a can
               of peas or couple of candles for a cus-
               tomer. An entertaining talker, she knits
               swiftly while carried away with her
               stories and suddenly throws her work to
               the floor to emphasize a point. Una s
               sweaters are exceptionally rich with in-
               terlaced designs, reminiscent of the pat-
               terning on Celtic stones and crosses.
               Mary Flaherty, mother of nine, knits
               with amazing speed even while walking
               down the road with three of her young-
               est clutching at her skirts. Garrulous
               and multicrafted, these animated wom-
               en live within a contradiction of clutter
               and simple geometry. In the rooms, the
               two most common design elements-
               frames and conscriptive devices which</p>
            <p>
               force the framed items into assemblies.
               groups—give the sense of rootedness,
               enclosure, a life of clear limits, a
               grounded life with few choices. Yet
               there are in both the sweater and kitch-
               en design, contrary effects of intense,
               crowded together activity: the wildest
               puckishness within an economic pin-
               point.
               Kate Conneely’s kitchen was often
               transformed by a heady stream of lan-
               guage from Kate herself, her children
               and her cranky, bragging 87-year-old
               mother. A battery of kettles and pots
               were kept on the stove at all times. Shoe
               repairing, baking, butter churning.
               clothes washing, butchering, saddle
               mending, knitting. Often such activities
               required furniture to be shifted about
               and the room to take on an entirely dif
               ferent character. A heavy clothes wash-
               ing called for the table and chairs to be
               moved out of the way, a massive
               amount of hot water boiled on the
               stove, the big tin tub moved in from the
               fields, sleeves to be rolled up and the
               floor to be doused with sudsy water.
               The long wall in the back of the house
               would be decked with clean wet sheets,
               shirts, underwear, trousers, pinafores,
               and these would have rocks placed on
               top of them so that the newly washed
               clothes would not blow away.
               Two ancient grandmothers are sta-
               tioned statuelike, in territorial posses</p>
            <p>
               sion of their spot in front of the fire,
               The population here, which includes
               animals welcome (dogs) and unwel-
               come (cats and chickens), is trans-
               formed during special occasions: dances
               with four accordionists, four or five
               singers taking turns between jigs, horn-
               pikes, waltzes and polkas. During
               wakes, the corpse is laid out in the side
               bedroom and the kitchen is filled with
               people all night long.
               Given the generations, needs, events
               of an Aran home, art is indeed not a
               central fact. As 1 was leaving, Kate
               said: “Patricia, it’s a pity you re leav-
               ing now, because one of those two old
               ladies at the stove will be going soon.
               We’ll have a great night here, that
               time. The two old women were nod-
               ding in agreement: “Yes, it’s a pity.
               Life’s conditions in the awesome
               stoneyard of Aran don’t leave any ap-
               parent space for the visual arts. Yet,
               the cheapest item, as well as the most
               honored elder, gains presence” by the
               way the women decorate the kitchens
               and design their sweaters. The intense,
               rectilinear use of space creates a fun, a
               garrulity, that is not unlike the famous
               Island talk. Wherever the eye lands,
               there is an elaborate fooling with decor-
               ation, intentional or otherwise.
