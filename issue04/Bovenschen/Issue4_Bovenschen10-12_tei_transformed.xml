				<p>This article was first published in German in Aesthetik und Kommunika- tion, No.

				<head>Old and new appraisals of womenâs artistic production</head>
				<p>The time has come for a campaign against all the weeping and wailing. Even the
					media have got the hang of itâwith their usual inconsequence. Women are
					oppressed, exploited, degraded... Although this state of affairs has hardly
					changed since it was first articulated, to continue to proclaim it now in the
					artistic realm seems almost pointless. But this need not necessarily be the
					case. As can be seen on closer examination, it is the tone of the lament that
					makes it seem inadequate. The form the lament takes still acknowledges its
					addressee. Traditionally it was womenâprofessional mournersâwho rendered grief
					public, be it in regard to death, to suffering or to the victims of massacres;
					this was one of their rare opportunities to assume a public function. But
					precisely for this reason it was not at all startling, indeed, no one particularly noticed, when women began publicizing and decrying their own lot, that of
					their sisters, their female ancestors and, should womenâs fate not improve, the
					lot of future women. Clearly, Cassandra was not a false prophet. She was simply
					not heard. No one paid attention to her.</p>

				<p>For this reason I thought it tedious to enumerate once again the entire battery
					of obstacles constructed to frighten off and exclude women from the artistic
					realm. Yet the handicaps and the absences are also part of women's history, and
					perhaps even the greater part, since women did not clomp through history in combat boots, and their traces are fleeting and obscured. To be sure, we do not
					complain as much today because we have a movement making demands that will
					change the future. Nevertheless, in respect to the question of a feminine
					aesthetic," we need to reexamine its traditional assessments once again, if
					only for the reason that we lack a viable conceptual basis to work from.</p>
				<p>Repeatedly and rightfully women have bemoaned the deformations of even their own
					cultural taste": "I would ... far sooner have been caught dead with Hemingway than
					with Virginia Woolf in my hands,"<note type="scolarNote">Shulamith Firestone, The Dialectic of Sex (New York, 1970), p. 161.</note> says Shulamith Firestone about her
					development. The pursuit of art, often based on the search for a realm of
					sensitivity in hopes of thereby escaping the confines of the home, may become a
					trap for women just as easily as other pur- suits. When discussing that which we
					associate with patriarchal structures in the cultural realm, we immediately take
					note of a scandalous situation which, along with many others, was un- covered
					long ago but still prevails. Just to refresh our memory, Simone de Beauvoir
					established long ago that men mistake their descriptive perspective for absolute
					truth. The scandalous situa- tion, then, is: the equation of truth with the
					masculine perspective, that is, with everything observed, examined and portrayed
					from a male point of view, which we were made to adopt very early in life. This
					false equation not only predominated in the production and reception of art. It
					also guaranteed that, despite our fervent endeavor, this sphere remained
					external, foreign and remote. This was but one reason for our exclusion among
					the many overt and lucid strategies employed by men to repress us when they
					found that our perceptive powers had not been sufficiently blunted.</p>

				<quote>Mr. de Keraty followed me into the anteroom in order to debate with me, at
					yet greater length, his theory concerning the intellectual inferiority of women.
					It would be impossible for even the most intelligent woman to write a good work.
					And as I wanted to leave then, he ended his speech with a Napoleonic stroke,
					which was to shatter me. "Believe me," he said in a weighty tone, as I was about
					to open the last door of his sanctuary, "bring children into the world instead
					of books!" "My dear " I answered, thinking I would choke on my laughter and
					slamming the door shut in his face, "follow your advice yourself, as well as you
					can!"</quote>
				<p>The classic notions about women's artistic competence are all too familiar.
					Though she is the great theme of art, woman as empirical being is acceptable
					only by virtue of her supposed inspirational powers. In an Amazon society
					there could be neither culture nor history nor art, since art is not essential
					to woman.<note type="scholarNote">Karl Scheffler, Die Frau und die Kunst (Berlin, 1908), p. 29.</note> We know today, though only because we bothered to look into the matter
					ourselves, that it is not difficult to prove that such statements are
					historically incorrect. They show (and help justify) that the masculine realm of
					artistic production, and often the artistic products themselves, are not only
					inaccessible to women, but are also fundamentally foreign to us.</p>
				<p>Critics have always regarded the female producers of literature, art and music,
					few and far between as they are, as exotic aber- rations. From a purely
					quantitative point of view, this indeed was and still is the case, although we
					have yet to rediscover the many women artists who were consciously forgotten. To
					be sure, women's representation in the arts is a rarity. And even this rarity is
					always measured in terms of production norms within the established framework
					defining the division of artistic labor, a framework which does not encompass
					forms of social creativity. And when a few works do manage to find their way to
					the public despite all obstacles placed in their path, they tend to be viewed in
					the following manner: Though women may have ac- complished some rather nice and
					enjoyable things now and then, all the major innovative achievements have
					nonetheless remained the exclusive territory of the great masters of the pen,
					the brush or the keyboard. (Thus any mounting anxiety can be quickly and easily
					quelled.)</p>
				<p>But now there is a threat from the other front: the theoretician of equality.
					Today the line of argument emphasizing equality belongs to the repertoire of the
					man who moves in "progressive" circles. He says that since they can no longer be
					kept completely ignorant, women should at least turn out to be what men already
					are. One need only open the floodgates, and women will stream into the spheres
					dominated by men. But what if we no longer view the difference as deficiency,
					loss, self-effacement and deprivation, but rather as opportunity? Around the
					turn of the century, the statement " We women can do just as much as men' served
					as a beckoning light. Today it is no longer so terribly impressive. Of course we
					could do just as much. The question is, do we want to do just as much as men, or
					the same thing as men? Here we have come full circle. So it would seem.</p>

				<quote>If women imitate men's battles they will become weaker and weaker. They must
					find new forms of struggle. This became evident in Hendave where women
					demonstrated against the death sentence in Spain. Some women shouted and
					clenched their fists, while others just hummed. They went "mmmmmmm" with their
					lips pressed together, and moved forward in a row. That is a new way of
					demonstrating which can be a hundred times stronger than fists. We have had a
					virtual inflation of shouting with raised fists, and I, for one, simply walk
					by when I hear it. In film and in the arts we must also find a language which is
					appropriate to us, one which is neither black nor white.</quote>
				<p>Art has been primarily produced by men. Men have dominated the neatly segregated
					public sector that controls it, and men have defined the normative standards for
					evaluation. Moreover, insofar as they came into contact with this sector at all,
					women have for the most part acquiesced to its value system. These realizations
					led Firestone to the conclusion that "It would take a denial of all cultural
					tradition for women to produce even a true 'female' art.<note type="scholarNote">Firestone, Dialectic of Sec, p. 159.</note> Such a statement is
					easily made. Indeed, aesthetic norms and cultural standards have meaning only in
					their sublation. But those standards and those norms were not even our own. What
					is the ground that we are working? From where does a feminine' art get its
					identity? Or does it not need to do that? Is art, then, still art <pb n="11"/>
					in the traditional sense, no matter how far it has gone to the dogs? Is "feminine" a criterion of substance, an ontological entity? </p><p>Let us then radically negate
					all the masculine cultural achievements and begin anew at the point where we
					once left off, tilling the soil as our female ancestors did before the great
					male putsch. That is not very funny, even as a powder room joke. Perhaps we
					would enjoy thatâlinking ourselves directly to bygone power, but we should be
					wary of construing a direct connection where none exists. Making such a
					connection can raise false hopes of finding help.</p>
				<p>Call as often as we might to the old mother goddessesâAphrodite, Demeter, Diana
					and all the rest of those Amazons of long lost female empiresâtheir power cannot
					reach this far, for their empires have been extinguished. Only the important
					consciousness that things were once different eases our burden a bit. To be
					sure, it is very important that we reappropriate moments of female potential
					from past cultures which have been silenced in organized fashion by male
					history. And the work to be done in this area is immense. (I emphasize this to
					avoid any misunderstanding.) But any attempt to link them directly to our
					experiences in the twentieth century will be unsuccessful. And if we nonetheless
					force a direct connection, the results will be downright pitiful. We will be
					left with parsley as a method of inducing abortion, and here and there a herbal
					home remedy.</p>
				<p>The desire to tailor a positive (female) counterpart to the world that was
					constructed and interpreted by men is not satisfied in this manner. Let us
					rather quote the women of the past as we wish, without being pressured into
					retroactively fabricating continuity. On the other hand, though, a historical
					archeology in search of women past and forgotten, their obscured activities,
					living condi- tions and forms of resistance, is not just nostalgia. The hidden
					story of women, which reveals itself to us as primarily one of suf- fering and
					subjugation (now <emph>here</emph> is continuity!), is the dark side of cultural historyâor
					better: the dark side of its idealized version. Women artists waÃ®t through
					history as mere shadows, separated from each other. Since their deeds remained
					for the most part without effect and their creations were, with rare exception,
					ab- sorbed into the masculine tradition, it is not possible to retro- spectively
					construct an independent countertradition. Only female martyrs are not in short
					supply. All of this would certainly seem to be grounds enough for avoiding even
					the most trifling involvement with the problems of art and cultural history.</p>
				<p>But the Great Refusal is not the solution either. To believe that feminine
					spontaneity need be creative in every case is to fail to recognize the powerful
					effect that cultural and historical deforma- tion also had on the subjectivity
					of women, as mentioned by Firestone. Can women just be women," reduced to some
					elemen- tal Being? We are in a terrible bind. How do we speak? In what
					categories do we think? Is even logic a bit of virile trickery? Or to put it
					even more heretically, how do we feel? Are our desires and notions of happiness
					so far removed from cultural traditions and models? Feminism cannot ultimately
					imply that we are to stop thinking, feeling, longing. No one ever claimed that.
					On the con- trary, we are consciously just beginning to do these things. No
					doubt, we have always done these things differently than men. (We are dealing
					with a sort of double exposure here.) But the means of expression most readily
					available to us for communica- ting our perceptions, our thought
					processesâlanguage, forms, imagesâare for the most part not originally our
					own, not of our own choosing. Here we are still at the beginning. Sensitivity to
					the patriarchal structures common to language usage<note type="scholarNote">Verena Stefan, Hautungen (1975), English translation under teh title Shedding (translation by Johanna Moore and Beth Weckmueller) to be published in Spring, 1978 by Daughters, Inc., New York.</note> is certainly a step in this

				<head>The pre-aesthetie realms</head>
				<p>Even in the past, I contend, the exclusion of women from the ar- tistic realm
					could not extinguish all their aesthetic needs. These creative impulses,
					however, were shunted off into the "pre-aesthetic' realms, where they
					evaporated under the strain of women's daily routine. Women furnished the living
					quarters, set the tables, arranged, decorated and adorned their clothing and
					above all themselves.</p>
				<p>That was allowed, as long as it was being done to please the man. These
					activities quickly corrupted women. They set the table for the man, they dressed
					and adorned themselves for the manânot for themselves or for each other, but
					rather in compe- tition with each other. They busied themselves weaving and
					knitting, but such functional artworks, handicrafts and decorations have
					always been considered inferior, commonplace. This verdict is of course not
					entirely unfair, especially in those cases where even these most timid efforts
					were channeled into subservient obsequi- ousness and excessive
					affection-seeking.</p>

				<p>Here the ambivalence once again: on the one hand we see aesthetic activity
					deformed, atrophied, but on the other we find, even within this restricted
					scope, socially creative impulses which, however, have no outlet for aesthetic
					development, no oppor- tunities for growth.</p>
				<p>It is true that these activities never had to become static, un- changing
					artistic norms. They never became obsolete products; they remained bound to
					everyday life, feeble attempts to make this sphere more aesthetically pleasing.
					But the price for this was nar- rowmindedness. The object could never leave the
					realm in which it came into being, it remained tied to the household, it could
					never break loose and initiate communication.</p>
				<p>But what would happen if someday we cleared out this realm and opened it only to

				<p>Perhaps that is all too simple, too superficial. Attempting to knit the gap
					between the artistic realm and social reality is problematic in that this gap is
					not simply the result of foolish blunder, but is rather the result of particular
					preconditions.</p>
				<p>Women succeeded in entering the artistic realm when they gained access to it via
					the adjoining "pre-aesthetic" realms. In the eighteenth century women were able
					to enter the realm of literature by means of letters (the epistolary novel),
					since this was an age in which letters and novels were gaining dignity and the
					dissolution of rigid formal rules allowed greater flexibility. Experience
					could be gained in writing private letters. Since letters and diaries have no
					clearly defined literary niche, it was all right for women to practice on them.
					Only the Romantics considered conversationâanother feminine domain in
					literatureâto be aesthetic activity. Men were amazed by the new tenor, the new
					tone, the irreverence and more sensual descriptions unique to women's letters,
					and on occasion they even showed open admiration. It did not take long for this
					medium to be included in the literary canon.</p>
				<p>But it is difficult to merely reach back and link up to these "feminine"
					mediaâletters, weaving. It is, in fact, almost more difficult to do this than to
					work with the "unfeminine" technical media such as film, since these need not
					contend with being traditionally relegated to the domain of the housewife. We
					should not foster the false assumptions that our sewing teachers indeed pointed
					us in the right direction. There is no direct path from the decorative potholder
					to the tapestries of Abakanovicz. Besides, I am still horrified by the whole
					ruffles-and-sewing basket business we were subjected to as young girls.</p>
				<p>I believe that feminine artistic production takes place by means of a complicated
					process involving conquering and reclaiming, appropriating and formulating, as
					well as forgetting and subverting. In the works of those female artists who are
					concerned with the womenâs movement, one finds artistic tradition as well as the
					break with it. It is goodâin two respectsâthat no formal criteria for feminist
					art' can be definitively laid down. It enables us to re- ject categorically the
					notion of artistic norms, and it prevents renewal of the calcified aesthetics
					debate, this time under the guise of the feminist approach.</p>
				<p>If, however, women have different assumptions with regard to their sensory
					approach, their relationship to matter and material, their perception, their
					experience, their means of processing tac- tile, visual and acoustic stimuli,
					their spatial orientation and temporal rhythmâand all these things are what
					aesthetics meant at one time, according to its original definition as a theory
					of sensory perceptionâthen one could logically expect to find these things expressed in special forms of mimetic transformation. Put em phatically, this
					would mean that within the framework of a female cosmology there would be a
					changed relationship between the sub- jective artistic appropriation of reality
					on the one hand, and formal suggestiveness and receptive perception on the
					other. But it will be nearly impossible to find categorical evidence for this
					changed relationship: reality is not that logical, and there is no female
					cosmology either.</p>
				<p>There is no proof of a different (female) relationship to detail and generality,
					to motionlessness and movement, to rhythm and demeanor., I find the only
					sensible approach to be the search for evidence within individual, concrete
					texts (pictures, films, etc.), as Virginia Woolf once attempted with Dorothy
					Richardson's writing.</p>

				<quote>She has invented, or, if she has not invented, developed and applied to her
					own uses, a sentence which we might call the psychological sentence of the
					feminine gender. It is of a more elastic fibre than the old, capable of
					stretching to the extreme, of suspending the frailest particles, of enveloping
					the vaguest shapes. Other writers of the opposite sex have used sentences of
					this description and stretched them to the extreme. But there is a difference.
					Miss Richardson has fashioned her sentence consciously, in order that it may
					descend to the depths and investigate the crannies of Miriam Henderson's
					consciousness. It is a woman's sentence, but only in the sense that it is used
					to describe a woman's mind by a writer who is neither proud nor afraid of
					anything that she may discover in the psychology of her sex.</quote> </div>

				<p>The exclusion of women from vast areas of production and the public sphere and
					the fact that most women have been responsible for the biological and social
					reproduction of the species, as well as the economic, if they are working, has
					directed women's imagination along other lines. Moreover, the much touted
					"ahistoricity" of women kept the polarity between intellectual labor and manual
					labor from becoming too traumatic. The disparate development of the sexes,
					though origin of so much of women's suffering, fortunately has not yet allowed
					women's behavior and needs to become reified to the degree found in advanced
					capitalism. But generations of women paid for this with their banishment into
					the marital ghetto.</p>
				<p>Is there a feminine aesthetic? Certainly there is, if one is talking about
					<emph>aesthetic awareness</emph> and <emph>modes of sensory perception</emph>. Certainly not, if one is
					talking about an unusual variant of artistic production or about a
					painstakingly constructed theory of art. Women's break with the formal,
					intrinsic laws of a given medium, the release of their imaginationâthese are
					unpredictable for an art with feminist intentions. There is, thank heavens, no
					premediated strategy which can predict what happens when femail sensuality
					is freed. Because it is a process and historically tentative, we cannot verbally
					anticipate this freeing of feminine sensuality either at its traditional erotic
					center (even though there's a lot going on there every month) or in the
					context of individual choice. We can do it only on the basis of a movement by
					women for women.</p>
				<p>The important thing is that women artists will not let themselves be kept back
					anymore. They work on canvas, they make films and videotapes, they write and
					sculpt, they work with metal and with fabric, they are on stage. So let us take
					a look at what they are doing. </p>
