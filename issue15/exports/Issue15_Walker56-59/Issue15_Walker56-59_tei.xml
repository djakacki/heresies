				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>light, in her mind), that his ownership is intact.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>When Mrs. Turner brings her brother over and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>introduces him, Tea Cake has a &quot;brainstorm.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>Before the week is over, he has &quot;whipped&quot; Janie.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>He whips her not, Hurston writes, &quot;because
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>her behavior justified his jealousy, but it relievec
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>that awful fear inside him. Being able to whip her
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>reassured him in possession. No brutal beating at
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>all. He just slapped her around a bit to show he
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>was boss. Everybody talked about it next day in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>the fields. It aroused a sort of envy in both men
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>and women. The way he petted and pampered
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>her as if those two or three face slaps had nearly
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>killed her made the women see visions and the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>helpless way she hung on him made men dream
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>dreams.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>An astute reader would realize that this is the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>real reason Tea Cake is killed by Janie in the end.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>Or, rather, this is the reason Hurston permits
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>Janie to kill Tea Cake in the end. For all her  help¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>less&quot; hanging on to him, Janie knows she has
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>been publicly humiliated, and though she acts the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>role of battered wife (from what I read, coming
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>out of battered women&apos;s shelters, the majority of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l53' n='N053'/>such batterings end in sex and the total submis¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l54' n='N054'/>sion—hanging on helplessly&quot;—of the wife), her
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l55' n='N055'/>developing consciousness of self does not stop at
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l56' n='N056'/>that point. She could hardly enjoy knowing her
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l57' n='N057'/>beating becomes visions&quot; for other women¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l58' n='N058'/>who would have to imagine themselves light
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l59' n='N059'/>and long-haired, like Janie, to &apos;enjoy“ them—or
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l60' n='N060'/>dreams, i.e., sexual fantasies, for Tea Cake&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l61' n='N061'/>male friends.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l62' n='N062'/>&quot;Tea Cake, you sho is a lucky man,&quot; Sop-de¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l68' n='N068'/>Dat&apos;s de reason Ah done quit beating mah women.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l69' n='N069'/>You can&apos;t make no mark on &apos;em at all. Lawd!

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>[To which Tea Cake replies:
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>Mah Janie is uh high time woman and useter
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>things. Ah didn&apos;t get her outa de middle uh de road.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>What is really being said here?
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>What is being said is this: that in choosing the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>fair,&quot; white-looking woman, the black man as¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>sumes he is choosing a weak woman. A woman
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>he can own, a woman he can beat, can enjoy
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>beating, can exhibit as a woman beaten; in short,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>a conquered&quot; woman who will not cry out, and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>will certainly not fight back. And why? Because
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>she is a lady, like the white man&apos;s wife, who is
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>also beaten (the slaves knew, the servants knew
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>the maid always knew because she doctored the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>bruises) but who has been trained to suffer in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>silence. Even to pretend sex is better afterward,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>that she enjoys it because her husband obviously
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>does. A masochist.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>And who is being rejected? Those women
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>out of the middle of the road&quot;? Well, Harriet
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>Tubman, for one, Sojourner Truth, Mary McCleod
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>Bethune, Shirley Chisholm, Ruby McCullom, As¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>sata Shakur, Joan Little and Dessie &quot;Rashida
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>Woods. You who are black-skinned and fighting
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>and screaming through the solid rock of America
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>up to your hip pockets every day since you ar¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>rived, and me, who treasures every 99 rows of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>my jaw teeth, because they are all I have to chew
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>my way through this world.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>That black men choose light and white women
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>is not the women&apos;s fault, any more than it was
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>their fault they were chosen as concubines to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>rich plantation owners during slavery. Nobody
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>seems to choose big, strong, fighting light or white
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>women (and these have existed right along with
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>those who could be beaten). Though there used to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>be a saying among black men that fat white wom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>en are best because the bigger they are the more
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>whiteness there is to love, this is still in the realm
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>of ownership, of &quot;prize. And any woman who
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>settles for being owned, for being a &quot;prize, is
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>more to be pitied than blamed
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>We are sisters of the same mother, but we
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>have been separated—though put to much the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>same use—by different fathers. In the novels of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>Frank Yerby, a wildly successful black writer,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>you see us: the whiter-skinned black woman
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>placed above the blacker as the white man&apos;s mis¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>tress or the black man&apos;s &quot;love. The blacker
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>woman, when not preparing the whiter woman
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>for sex, marriage or romance, simply raped. Put
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>to work in the fields. Stuck in the kitchen. Raising
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>everybody&apos;s white and yellow and brown and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>black kids. Or knocking the overseer down, or
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>cutting the master&apos;s throat. But never desired or
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>romantically loved, because she does not care for
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>aesthetic&apos; suffering. Sexual titillation is out, be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>cause when you rape her the bruises don&apos;t show
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>so readily, and besides, she lets you know she
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>hates your guts, goes for your balls with her
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>knees, and calls you the motherfucker (in the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>original sense) you are until you knock her out.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>Perhaps one problem has been that so many
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>of our leaders (and writers) have not been black¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>skinned themselves. Think of William Wells
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>Brown, who could pass; Charles W. Chesnutt,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>who could and did pass; Jean Toomer, who passed
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>with a vengeance; Langston Hughes, who could
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>pass (when young) as a Mexican; Booker T. Wash¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>ington, John Hope Franklin, James Weldon John-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>son, Frederick Douglass, W.E.B. Du Bois, Arna
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>Bontemps, Nella Larsen, Richard Wright, Chester
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>Himes, Frank Yerby—all very different in ap¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>pearance from, say, Wallace Thurman, who was
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>drawn to write about a black black woman be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>cause he was so black himself, and blackness
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>was a problem for him among other blacks lighter
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>than himself, as it was among whites. We can
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>continue to respect and love many of these writ¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>ers, and treasure what they wrote because we
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>understand America; but we must be wary of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>their depictions of black women because we
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>understand ourselves.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>In his landmark essay &quot;Of the Dawn of Free¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>dom&quot; (1903), W.E.B. Du Bois wrote:The problem
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>of the twentieth century is the problem of the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>color-line—the relation of the darker to the light¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>er races of men in Asia and Africa, in America
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>and the islands of the sea. It was a phase of this
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>problem that caused the Civil War. This is a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>true statement, but it is a man&apos;s vision. That is to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>say, it sees clearer across seas than across the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>table or the street. Particularly it omits what is
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>happening within the family, &quot;the race&quot; at home;
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>a family also capable of civil war.
			</p>
			<pb n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>In paraphrase of this statement I would say
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>that the problem of the 21st century will still be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>the problem of the color-line, not only &quot;of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>relation of the darker races of men [sic) in Asia
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>and Africa, in America and the islands of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>sea,&quot; but of the relations between the darker and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>the lighter people of the same races, and of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>women who represent both dark and light within
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>each race. It is our familial&quot; relations with each
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>other in America that we need to scrutinize. And
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>it is the whole family, rather than the dark or the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>light, that must be affirmed.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>Light- and white-skinned black women will
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>lose their only link to rebellion against white
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>America if they cut themselves off from the black
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>black woman. Their children will have no hip
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>pockets in which to keep their weapons, no teeth
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>with which to chew up racist laws. And black
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>black women will lose the full meaning of their
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>history in America (as well as the humor, love
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>and support of good sisters) if they see light and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>white black women only as extensions of white
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>and black male oppression, while allowing them¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>selves to be made ashamed of their own strength
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>and fighting spirit: that fighting spirit that is our
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>birthright, and, for some of us, our &quot;rusty black&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>joy.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>As black women, we have been poorly pre¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>pared to cherish what should matter most to us.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>Our models in literature and life have been, for
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>the most part, devastating. Even when we wish it,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>we are not always able to save ourselves for
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>future generations: not our spiritual selves, not
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>our physical characteristics. (In the past, in our
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>literature—and in life too—the birth of a &quot;gold¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>en&quot; child to a dark mother has been perceived as
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>a cause for special celebration. But was it? So
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>much of the mother was obliterated, so much
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>changed in the child, whose birth as often as not
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>was by her unplanned.) But perhaps we can
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>learn something, even from the discouraging
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>models of earlier centuries and our own time.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>Perhaps black women who are writers in tle 21st
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>century will present a fuller picture of the multi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>plicity of oppression—and of struggle. Racism,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>Sexism, Classism and Colorism will be very much
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>a part of their consciousness. They will have the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>wonderful novels of black African women to read
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>—Buchi Emecheta, Ama Ata Aidoo, Bessie Head
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>and others—as 19th-century black women did
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>not. They will have a record of the struggles of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>our own times. They will not think of other wom¬
