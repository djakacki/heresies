				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>Human culture has been viewed by his¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>tory as the product of &quot;mankind&apos;s&quot; efforts.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>Most of the events and achievements
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>chosen for posterity as significant have
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>been dominated and determined by males.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>However, there are histories other than
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>those of modern post-industrial nation/
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>states. In traditional societies, located in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>what is often called the Third World,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>women have played a crucial role in the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>formation of cultural features vital to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>human existence. One such area, not usu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>ally credited to women, is architecture. In
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>traditional cultures, women are often the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>builders and owners of structures, pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>viding shelter and creating the conditions
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>for social interaction.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>Although I will use the &quot;ethnographic
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>present&quot; in most of this article, many of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>the traditional non-state societies in North
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>America and Africa on which I focus here

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>original forms. Their structures differ
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>vastly from those of modern states. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>of these societies are small bands of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>gatherers and hunters, some are semi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>nomadic peoples who seasonally follow
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>herds, and others pursue a form of farm¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>ing called horticulture, where the local
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>économy is self-sufficient and women are
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>frequently the farmers.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>Initially victimized by colonization,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>virtually all those societies that remain are
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>now undergoing &quot;modernization.“ If we
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>lose the histories of these cultures, we will
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>also lose an important part of the history
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>of women&apos;s roles in world culture, for in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>societies whose traditions remain intact,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>the roles women play are central to their
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>cultures—not on the sidelines, where our
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>culture seems to wish us to be. In light of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>this, contemporary feminists&apos; identifica¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>tion and re-creation of &quot;women&apos;s culture“
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>can be seen not just as a protest against
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>oppression, but as a recognition of the ar¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>bitrary denigration of the history of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>women&apos;s activities. The discovery that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>architecture is a traditional woman&apos;s art
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>opens up the possibility for a new under¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>standing of our role in the formation of

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>Societies of gatherers and hunters lived
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>in small bands, constantly moving within
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>a relatively large territory from which
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>they foraged for plants and animals. These

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l30' n='N030'/>vironments. Women and men regard each
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l31' n='N031'/>other as equals. Among the BaMbuti,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l32' n='N032'/>hunting is a joint effort, men care for
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l33' n='N033'/>babies and women enter public discus¬

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l1' n='N001'/>vide up to eighty percent of the food and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l2' n='N002'/>as an extension of their expertise in plants
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l3' n='N003'/>and fibers (with which they make nets),
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l4' n='N004'/>they are also the builders. The dwelling
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l5' n='N005'/>the women construct usually consists of a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l6' n='N006'/>framework woven like an inverted loose
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l7' n='N007'/>basket, covered or thatched with avail¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l8' n='N008'/>able materials such as large leaves, bun¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l9' n='N009'/>dles of grass or woven mats. These shel¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>ters share significant characteristics across
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l11' n='N011'/>cultures. They are flexible, often flooded
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l12' n='N012'/>with translucent light, and scented with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l13' n='N013'/>the smoke of fires and fragrant floor cov¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l14' n='N014'/>erings. They are round, ovoid or conical,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l15' n='N015'/>with no edges or planes to interrupt the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l16' n='N016'/>flow of space. Their size and shape maxi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l17' n='N017'/>mizes physical and psychological contact
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l18' n='N018'/>among the dwellers. Anthropologists sug¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l19' n='N019'/>gest that such human proximity is particu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l20' n='N020'/>larly conducive to intuitive and non¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l21' n='N021'/>verbal communication, to the develop¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l22' n='N022'/>ment of internalized cultural rhythms.“
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l23' n='N023'/>In our Western cultures, such tacit syn¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l24' n='N024'/>chrony is usually found only in mother¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l25' n='N025'/>infant relationships, a vestige of what was
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l26' n='N026'/>once the nature of communication be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l27' n='N027'/>tween both sexes and all ages.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l28' n='N028'/>A freudian theorist might suggest that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l29' n='N029'/>the organic nature of gatherers&apos; dwellings
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l30' n='N030'/>is a cultural extension of the biophysical
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l31' n='N031'/>environment of the womb. But in fact,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l32' n='N032'/>these shelters can be extremely open and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l33' n='N033'/>unwomblike. They include unsheltered
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l34' n='N034'/>areas where the work of the household,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l35' n='N035'/>such as plaiting mats and scraping skins,

			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>takes place. The house life overflows into
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>outdoor space, allowing the activities of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>its inhabitants to expand. Many gatherers
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>dwellings are easily adaptable, and when
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>not easily expanded (as in the hemispheri¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>cal scherms of the IKung) there is flexibil¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>ity as to who inhabits them. Children do
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>not have to sleep with their parents, and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>can either stay with their grandparents or
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>make camp with other children of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>same sex at either end of the settlement.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>Thus the gatherers&apos; house is not a struc¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>ture enforcing family isolation, but serves
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>as a shelter of great social fluidity.

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>In these mobile cultures land is not in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>dividually owned and no dwelling is per-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>manent. Women possess the building
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>know-how rather than the actual struc¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>tures, which they may erect collectively.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>The building activity may be almost ritu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>alized, as the &quot;performer“ sets into mo¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>Now she squatted down making her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>own home, driving the saplings into
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>the ground with sharp thrusts, each
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>time in exactly the same place, so
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>that they went deeper and deeper.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>When she had completed a circle she
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>stood up and deftly bent the fito over
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>her head, twisting them together and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>twining smaller saplings across form-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>ing a lattice framework. Then she
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>took the leaves we had collected and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>slit the stalks toward the end, like
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>clothespins, hooking two or three of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>them together. When she had enough
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>she started hanging them on the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>framework like tiles, overlapping
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>each other and forming a waterproof
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>covering. There were leaves left over
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>when she had finished, so she let
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>other women take them for their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>houses.“
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>The dwelling in the gathering culture is
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>the focal point of women&apos;s creative activi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>ties. Since it is usually constructed from
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>materials that can be replaced from avail¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>able natural sources, it also binds society

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>by temporary cultivation. Some semi¬

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l1' n='N001'/>of the grass house remained essential. For
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l2' n='N002'/>semi-nomadic desert dwellers, such as the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l3' n='N003'/>Pima and Papago of the American South¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l4' n='N004'/>west, the convenient raw materials for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l5' n='N005'/>building might still be plant fibers, par¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l6' n='N006'/>ticularly where the women were highly
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l7' n='N007'/>skilled basketweavers and had developed
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l8' n='N008'/>ways of weaving fibers into other forms,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l9' n='N009'/>such as cotton cloth or yucca-fiber san¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>dals. Up until the twentieth century the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l11' n='N011'/>Pima were dispersed in the winter and set¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l12' n='N012'/>tlements were occupied only for a few
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l13' n='N013'/>months during a short growing season.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l14' n='N014'/>The women built structures that mingled
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l15' n='N015'/>the style of mobile peoples with that of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l16' n='N016'/>the ancient Southwest Pueblos. Their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l17' n='N017'/>houses were grass but the interiors were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l18' n='N018'/>slightly below ground. Sometimes earth
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l19' n='N019'/>was used to anchor the lower portion of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l20' n='N020'/>the exterior wall, a feature which perhaps
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l21' n='N021'/>explains the evolution of the earth lodges
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l22' n='N022'/>built by the Navaho and by the Mandan
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l23' n='N023'/>further north.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l24' n='N024'/>Another feature of grass houses is the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l25' n='N025'/>tensile flexibility of the structure, which
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l26' n='N026'/>was later developed into the tent form. In

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_6_1l30' n='N030'/>closed tightly, to adapt to the wide range

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>to cover the walls, and to serve as carpets,

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>Plains were responsible for all aspects of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>the construction of their dwellings. They
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>developed one of the most striking forms
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>in women&apos;s vernacular architecture. The

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>the tipi was erected as well. These were
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>hard to find on the Plains, and made a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>useful sled (travois) for carrying house¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l27' n='N027'/>from the women of her family. Then a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l28' n='N028'/>female specialist was called in to cut and

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l4' n='N004'/>The Quillers&apos; Society met when a wom¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l8' n='N008'/>objects of spiritual power, and with the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l9' n='N009'/>vower, performed the rituals necessary
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>for the work to begin and end. She would

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>round, with a gabled and thatched roof
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>and walls made of wattle and daub. Each

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>or women. Male and female tasks vary
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>from society to society. Among the Kiku¬

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>women the roof. After the men finish their
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>work, they go to the feast celebrating the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>house building. They goad the women,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>calling them &quot;slow chameleons“ who will
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>miss the feast if they don&apos;t hurry. The

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l11' n='N011'/>social policy decisions. They appointed

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l19' n='N019'/>the Iroquois tribes recognized the signifi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l20' n='N020'/>cance of this woman-owned institution by
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l21' n='N021'/>naming themselves The League of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l22' n='N022'/>Longhouse.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l23' n='N023'/>There are few matrilineal cultivating
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l24' n='N024'/>societies remaining in the world. One of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l25' n='N025'/>their striking characteristics was that they
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l26' n='N026'/>were subsistence societies —that is, no
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l27' n='N027'/>wealth was accumulated from year to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l28' n='N028'/>year. Although the source of food and the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l29' n='N029'/>type of settlement differed, they shared
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l30' n='N030'/>this feature with the gathering peoples
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l31' n='N031'/>mentioned earlier. The change from sub¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l32' n='N032'/>sistence society to one in which it is pos¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l33' n='N033'/>sible to accumulate wealth frequently
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l34' n='N034'/>comes with the addition of livestock or
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l35' n='N035'/>herd animals to horticultural life. Such a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l36' n='N036'/>change in process was observed in the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l37' n='N037'/>early nineteenth century among the Man¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l38' n='N038'/>dan, a cultivating society living on the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l39' n='N039'/>North American Plains. Basically, the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l40' n='N040'/>Mandan lived two life styles. The matri¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l41' n='N041'/>lineal one dominated the life of the vil¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l42' n='N042'/>age, where women were the farmers and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l43' n='N043'/>owned and built the houses; the second
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l44' n='N044'/>was patrilineal, occurring during the sum-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l45' n='N045'/>mer months, when some of the women
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l46' n='N046'/>tended the fields, while most of the men
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l47' n='N047'/>and a few women went into the Plains to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l48' n='N048'/>hunt buffalo. This resulted in an impor¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l49' n='N049'/>tant division of economic tasks and calen¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l50' n='N050'/>dars —the women living by an older agri¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l51' n='N051'/>cultural calendar, and the men by the sea¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l52' n='N052'/>sonal migration of the buffalo herds.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l53' n='N053'/>In the Mandan village, the lodges the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l54' n='N054'/>women constructed were admirably
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l55' n='N055'/>suited to the climate of the Great Plains.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l56' n='N056'/>They may have originated as structures
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l57' n='N057'/>like those of the Pima. Walls of willow
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l58' n='N058'/>saplings and brush and a final layer of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l59' n='N059'/>earth were erected over a wooden frame.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l60' n='N060'/>The walls were built quite thick and the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l61' n='N061'/>lodges were cool in summer and warm in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l62' n='N062'/>winter. Quite possibly these were the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l63' n='N063'/>prototypes for the sod houses built by
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l64' n='N064'/>pioneers settling in the Plains in the nine¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_6_1l65' n='N065'/>teenth century.

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>If the Mandan had survived the epi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>demic of smallpox which destroyed the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>tribe in 1840, it is possible that they would
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>have become patrilineal, giving up culti¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>vation altogether to pursue the buffalo as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>other Plains tribes did. In patrilineal soci¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>eties, as we have seen with the Cheyenne,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>the woman&apos;s position is secure when she
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>continues to control important cultural or
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>economic features. Frequently these two
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>spheres are connected, as in societies
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>where women have a specialized architec¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>ture for their own activities. The Igbo
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>society in Nigeria is patrilineal, but with
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>the exception of the yam, all produce is
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>considered women&apos;s property; they sell
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>anything left over from feeding their fami¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>lies, becoming successful traders. A cen¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>tury ago when this marketing activity
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>was increasing, the women also began to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>construct ritual sanctuaries in groves out¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>side the villages. Called mbayo houses,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>these were maintained by a cult of the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>earth goddess Ala, and were decorated
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>with male and female symbols and erotic
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>figures.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>In patrilineal societies women may
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>have certain economic powers; if so, they
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>usually own their own houses within the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>compounds of their husbands&apos; families.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>But when men control agriculture and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>herding, or have access to a modern cash
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>market, the domicile and all public build¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>ings fall totally under male control. Men
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>erect the structures; if they are dwellings,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>women may decorate the walls. In Medi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>terranean villages in Spain, Greece and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>the Balkans, and in Islamic villages of the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>Near East and Africa, woman is associ¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>ated with the domicile as its caretaker, not
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>as its owner. The isolation of women in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>the home is, of course, a function of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>wealth. In poorer cultures the woman
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>may be forced to work for the family&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>survival, but in most places, she is sup¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>posed to remain in the home. In Spain,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>she decorates her house with whitewash
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>as a symbol of purity —both of the domi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>cile and of its keeper. When a woman&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>life is relegated to the private sphere of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>society, her significance in the culture ap¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>pears merely symbolic. She is a posses¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>sion to be protected. In Berber villages,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>she weaves inside her husband&apos;s house;
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>the loom is not considered her tool, but a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>symbol of male protection. Sitting behind
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>it, she is shielded from the door and from
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>the street life that lies beyond it.? Thus
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>women are isolated from the world of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>confrontation, conversation and public
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>interaction.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>With the advent of industrialism and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>the wage economy in any society, separa¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>tion of home life from public work be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>comes firmly entrenched. The many roles
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>of women are reduced to motherhood and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>housekeeping. The number of craftswom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>en, artists, businesswomen and builders
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>decrease. Separation of home from busi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>ness premises makes it more difficult for
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>women to share in a work world domi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>nated by men. Machine-made products
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>limit the type of paid work that can be
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>done in the household. Control over the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>design and construction of buildings
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>passes into the hands of &quot;professionals.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>Women&apos;s creativity is confined to plan¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>ning interiors and obtaining or making in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>terior decorations according to mass-pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>duced guides like women&apos;s magazines.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>Ironically, this vestige of woman&apos;s im¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>portance as architect and builder is used
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>against her when psychology and popular
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>belief insist that women are by nature&apos;
			</p>

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>oriented to interiors, and interiors alone.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>The home, as the exclusive province of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>women, has become a significant cultural

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>women&apos;s lives and the resulting obsession
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>with house/home. So now we paint,
