				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and politics from a femi
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>nist perspective. We believe that what is commonly called art can have a political impact, and that in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>the making of art and of all cultural artifacts our identities as women play a distinct role. We hope
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>that HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radical political and aesthetic theory, encourage the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>writing of the history of femina sapiens, and generate new creative energies among women. It will be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>a place where diversity can be articulated. We are committed to the broadening of the definition and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>function of art.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>HERESIES is structured as a collective of feminists, some of whom are also socialists, marxists,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>lesbian feminists or anarchists; our fields include painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, litera
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>ture, performance, art history, architecture and filmmaking. While the themes of the individual
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>issues will be determined by the collective, each issue will have a different editorial staff made up of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>contributors as well as members of the collective. Each issue will take a different visual form, chosen
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>by the group responsible. HERESIES will try to be accountable to and in touch with the international
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>feminist community. An open evaluation meeting will be held after the appearance of each issue.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Themes will be announced well in advance in order to collect material from many sources. (See inside
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of back cover for list of projected issues.) Possibly satellite pamphlets and broadsides will be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>produced continuing the discussion of each central theme.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our lives, our arts and our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ideas have been suppressed. Once these connections are clarified they can function as a means to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>dissolve the alienation between artist and audience, and to understand the relationship between art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and politics, work and workers. As a step toward a demystification of art, we reject the standard
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>relationship of criticism to art within the present system, which has often become the relationship of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>advertiser to product. We will not advertise a new set of genius-products just because they are made
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>by women. We are not committed to any particular style or aesthetic, nor to the competitive mentality
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that pervades the art world. Our view of feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that ir
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the process of this dialogue we can foster a change in the meaning of art

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>This issue of HERESIES was edited and produced by three groups which met separately and together for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>more than four months: a nine-woman editorial collective, which takes final responsibility for the magazine;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>an eight-woman adjunct group which worked on general ideas, research and specific articles; and a five-woman
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>design/production group. Still other women helped with additional aspects, such as copyediting, proofreading
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>and mechanicals, and the larger HERESIES Collective supported us all. Because of the number of women in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>volved and the number of manuscripts received (more than twice as many as were submitted to our first issue),
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the process was complex. Editorial work was new to most of us, and we needed a lot of time to listen to each
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>other, to reflect on our disparate experiences and viewpoints—and to develop an overview of the magazine,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>which finally affected our decisions almost as much as individual submissions. We worked collectively on each
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>piece, arriving at a consensus only after much discussion. Sometimes we frustrated those authors and artists who
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>had hoped to hear more from us sooner. As we worked, we found that we were indeed involved in a process of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>communication with all the women who wanted to participate in this issue, as well as with each other. If this
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>process was at times confusing, it was also intensely satisfying.

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>As this issue went into production, Ree Morton, an artist whose friendship, work and commitment to feminism
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>made her close to many ofus, died of injuries sustained in an automobile accident. We will miss her.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Woman has always been associated with the dark, with the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>unknown. It has been in society’s interest to consider women un
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>knowable; that has been one of the devices to keep us from
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>power. Separated then from the &quot;light&quot; of the dominant society,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>we women have perpetuated a culture of our own, expressed in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>our own forms, which has frequently been transmitted, as is the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>case with other oppressed cultures, in subtle, uncodified ways.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Not taught in schools, it is communicated in the home, through
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>kinship lines, laterally through sisters, grandmothers, friends. In
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>fluenced and affected by the dominant cultures within or against
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>which it must exist, this culture nevertheless seems to incorporate
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>certain universal elements which may in part be due to the fact
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that women everywhere are socialized into similar roles and op
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>pressions. Ironically, despite our universal oppression, women
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>seem to have survived as the guardians of certain human values
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>necessary to the survival of humanity. At the same time, these
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>values undermine the anti-human thrust of contemporary indus
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>trial and technological life. In bourgeois society, this contradic
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tion is solved through the relegation of women to the home, and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>our isolation from public life, which prevents those values from
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>entering the public sphere. Similarly, these contributions are fur
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ther devalued through their association with women and they
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>consequently lose their power to influence the direction of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>dominant culture. Certain survival values then persist in isolation
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>within the circumscribed female domain.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and attitudes resulting from the interaction of role, biology, his
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>torical conditions and memory. It has developed forms which
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>deny aggression, competition, rank and power—essentially non
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>hierarchical, intimate and cooperative forms. The tone with
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>which women address each other when we are alone, calling each
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>other immediately by our first names, the conversations women
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>have with other women are, in themselves, models of the entire
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>culture. Woman’s conversation is a particular form of communi

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>plex of other activities. When women speak to each other, the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>sentence functions both to communicate information and to es

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tion is often confined to intuition, accompanied by non-verbal
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>interaction, touch, eye contact, which enhance the intensity of

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Women so often talk about “women’s things&quot; because they are
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>more interested in the feeling of community than in an abstract
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>interchange, and what are commonly deprecated as &quot;women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>things&quot; are in fact those events of daily life common to everyone’s
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>experience. For example, when we introduce ourselves to each
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>other, we tend to avoid professional definitions, offering general
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>statements about our lives, some bit of information which can
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>create an intimate experience. Particularly since consciousness
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>raising, we introduce ourselves in terms of personal struggle,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>openly communicating the current internal dilemma or problem:
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>&quot;T’ve just divorced&quot; or &quot;T’m trying to get my life together.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Women are willing to reveal the raw materials in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>explore together. Women’s conversations may have a more &quot;un

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the known. If men’s conversations reveal, women’s conversations
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>explore.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I wish to create here a form appropriate to the subject of

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>appropriate to formal presentation is heavy and abstract. Each
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>idea is confined within a noun and those are arranged in order.

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>squares. These are organized into a grid in which no piece is more
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>important than another. The poster permits women to respond to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>a color which has been socially devaluated. Pink is assigned to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>women; baby pink, thrust upon us during infancy, remains our
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>color through old age. Its associations are with infantilism, indul
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>gence, frivolity. How, then, can we claim it? Yet the responses on

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>poster is responsive. It is a non-hierarchical structure. It is a com
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>munal effort. It evokes a variety of responses. It is complex. It
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>provides for reevaluation. It makes a feminist statement in form
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>as well as in content.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Why do I begin with Sheila? Because we came to this at the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>same time although quite independently. Sheila was the organizer
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>of the first Feminist Design Program at Cal Arts. She is also one

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>literature. We were both pursuing our private design and writing.

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>analysis with ordinary critical tools, as it departs from the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>dominant modes, goals and value systems. As we attempted to

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_6_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>that woman’s work corresponds to a particular organization of

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>It is said that woman is nature and man is culture.... It is

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>is expressed in behaviors that are responsive rather than closed, it
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>is mistaken to assume that response is negative or imposed. Re

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Recently I conducted a class in Secrets at Chino State Prison
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>for Women. While it was relatively easy to deal with some of the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>consequences of search, seizure, scrutiny by wardens and guards,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>it was more difficult to evaluate the risk of revelation to one&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>fellow prisoners. It was relatively easy to understand that the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>prison authorities were simply the active instruments of social
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>oppression and that acts of solidarity and revelation between
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>women inevitably undermined the oppressive forces. However, it
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>was more difficult to gauge the trust that was possible between
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>women living under these conditions, whose lives were often
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>regulated through the subtle manipulation of one woman against
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>another. How much could they reveal to each other? How care
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>fully would they honor each other’s secrets?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>As an act of faith, I first read a &quot;secret&quot; from my novel.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Then each woman wrote a &quot;secret&quot; to another woman in the
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>room, with whom she could but was not obliged to share her
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>writing. One woman decided to share her secret with the entire
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>group, confiding in us that this was the first time she had revealed
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the event to anyone, despite three years of psychoanalysis. This
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>was perhaps the first moment of social trust she had experienced.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>The secret, read in a trembling voice, was an agonized memory of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sadistic and sexual cruelty perpetrated upon her, pregnant at fif

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>she now knew that she had not been responsible for provoking
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>this incident. Fifteen years of guilt laid aside. Yet, listening to her
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>revelation in the hushed silence of the prison classroom, I won
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>dered if the support and love which allowed her to speak these
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>words were temporary. Would she be betrayed later? And how?
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>In any form, the guilt and pain had been a worm far more raven
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ous and lethal than any revelation could be now. Nevertheless, l

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Halprin’s dance workshop. Anna explains:
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>In our approach to theatre and dance, art grows
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>directly out of our lives. Whatever emotional, physical,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>or mental barriers ... we carry around within us in our
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>personal lives will be the same barriers that inhibit our
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>full creative expression..... I work with the notion
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that emotional blocks are tied into our physical body
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and mental images.....
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>When a person has reached an impasse we know
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>something in their life and in their art is not working.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>What is not working is their old dance. The old dance is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>made up of imprints imbedded in the muscles anc
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>nerves that is reflected in behavior patterns manifested

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Each morning we performed “movement ritual,&quot; a series of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>exercises through which we listened to our bodies, “hearing” how
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>we felt. According to Anna, “Daily movement ritual is a way of

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>morning at the end of movement ritual, Anna told us just to let
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>our bodies move themselves, without imposing any preset pat
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>terns, without interfering with notions of what might look
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>&quot;graceful.&quot; I lay there, not thinking about how to move. I felt my
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>legs gently pull apart, opening up my genitals, and my pelvis
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>tilted under, slowly lifting my torso upward and back down. The
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>experience was both real and unreal, as if my body were literally
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>talking to me, telling me how I felt. I watched, observing how my
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>body wanted to unfold, to open out, my pelvis widening, my
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>chest expanding. I got scared. And I retreated, my body closing
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in, curling up tighter and tighter. My &quot;dance” spoke to me about
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>my female sexuality in a way my head had never allowed.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>My body as a woman. A biological given. Each month I go
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>through the menstrual cycle. I sense the changes inside my body,

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>move, I can allow the flow to happen. Without the cramps of

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>women to get in touch with their feelings through their bodies.

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>I think about Erik Erikson’s article “Womanhood and Inner
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Space, and the controversy it raised.° Believing that play repre

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>that the differing spatial configurations of play scenes constructed
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>by children reflected the girls’ preoccupation with inner space
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>(womb) and the boys’ with outer space (penis). In a recent repli

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>as a positive assertion. My body is constructed differently from a
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>man’s. The sense of inner space —not a void, empty, waiting to

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>My body as a woman. Have I learned to hold my body in a

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>this, turning my arm, rotating my shoulder first in, then out.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Afterward my shoulders relaxed, heavy, weighted on the floor.

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>A friend told me that once, while working with her shoul

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>doing cartwheels, moving freely, naturally. The girl’s mother
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>called her over to walk beside mother and grandmother. The little

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>assumed the pose of “woman&quot; in imitation of her mother and

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>crossed — do not fidget. All those messages. And how do they

				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>interacting with women, men with men. The women began with
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>a rap session. Tentative, sensing each other, a preliminary.
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Anna then led us through a “movement preparation,” to take
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>us inside ourselves. While doing the exercise, we were to visualize
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>our &quot;life histories as women, to become aware of our woman
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>hood. We worked in pairs, focusing inward by concentrating on
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>our breathing. I sat on my partner Sara’s chest, pressing against
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>her shoulders as she exhaled, letting go as she inhaled. Then, in
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>another exercise, 1 gently pushed down on Sara’s stomach as she
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>breathed out. When she inhaled, I raised her up, my hands grip
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ping behind her, opening out her chest ... pulling her toward me
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>as I lay back on the ground ready to exhale. Repeat, reversing
				<lb facs='#facs_15_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>roles in seesaw alternation. Release, letting go — expansion, tak-

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>reflected our experiences of ourselves, our experiences as women.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Dana had depicted a child-woman standing small before an enor

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>greet her. Alone. On her own. Alice had drawn a little girl seated
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>in a yoga position with her arms held tightly against her body.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>She explained that at 31 she felt “too young&quot; to have children,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>that she herself was just a child. Alice looked at her breasts in dis

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>interior space —delicately pasteled, tenuous lines flowing into
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and around each other. Scribbled flames of orange-red anger sur

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Some of the women danced out their visualizations. The

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>using these drawings as a score for another dance encouraged a
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>dialogue with our experiences. Melinda had sketched an incident
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>from her childhood: while trying to prove her strength by climb
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ing a tree, she had fallen in front of her father and sister (her sister

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>flicting instructions —for her to be a &quot;lady” or a &quot;tomboy.” At
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>one point someone yelled, “You won’t have any boyfriends.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Melinda lashed out at this voice and burst into tears. She closed
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>her dance by convincingly repeating Anna’s words, &quot;I can cry
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>and still be strong.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Marlo’s dance was last. Her drawing was covered with
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>words: &quot;you can’t get out,&quot; “push me.&quot; Like Alice, she explained
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>she felt &quot;too young.&quot; In response, we formed a birth canal, offer

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>times she stopped, frustrated, and we taunted her gently, urging
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>her on. Finally Marlo reached Anna, who was waiting quietly at
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the other end. But Meg, the last woman in the canal, still held
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>onto Marlo’s legs. When the two separated, Meg curled into a
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>fetal position. The group gave birth to twins. Humming softly,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>we became a chorus cradling the two women. Marlo rocked,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>nestled quiet in Anna’s arms. Meg, in contrast, needed to laugh so
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that she could cry. And those of us surrounding the two women
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>were no longer simply performers enacting a score. We were par
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ticipants involved in a drama —not fiction but real. Each of us
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>was Meg and Marlo, woman finding her self, woman reborn.

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>emotional responses are locked into particular body attitudes. We
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>sank slowly, vertebra by vertebra, from a standing position, curl

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>we continued to shift from open to closed positions, we were told
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>to imagine a man in our lives looking at our bodies and to note
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>how we felt about his gaze. I saw first my father, then my friend

				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>pelvis expanded wide. As if by opening, I were to give up my self.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>My arms reached to hug my knees to my chest. No, I would not
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>show them my body, my femaleness.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Finally we spiraled on the ground, one leg rotating across the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>body, reaching forward, the corresponding arm rotating out,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>reaching back. We explored this movement, making it more and
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>more sensuous, twisting slowly, luxuriously, until we were danc-
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>ing our love for our female bodies, accepting our sexuality. Turn
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>ing the torso, tentative at first, reaching down to caress an ankle,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>a calf. Flowing from one movement to the next, exploring the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>fullness of the chest, the length of the neck, opening up to new
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>possibilities of movement, new ways of being. Each woman per
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>formed for the others, sharing her own discovery of the beauty of
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>her body, of her self. A celebration.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>In contrast, we spent the afternoon dealing with aggressive
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>energies, with what Anna called &quot;self-hate.&quot; We worked again in
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pairs. Alice lay down, hands beneath her head, elbows on the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ground. As she tried to lift her elbows up to bring them together,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>1 offered resistance by pressing down on them — not so much that
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>she couldn’t perform the movement, just enough to make it a
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>struggle. While striving to raise her elbows, each woman was to
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>let out a sound as a way of releasing energy and vocalizing her
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>emotional response. A welter of groans, screeching into shrieks,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>often climaxing in tears.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Again we drew our experiences and danced them out. My
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>image was a mountain, closed off in dense blackness, impenetra
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ble, with a tiny figure struggling desperately all alone to the top.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>A pretense of strength. The barrier from my earlier drawing ...l
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>am afraid to cry, afraid to show “weakness.&quot; I keep telling myself
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I can make it, I can make it, I don’t need anyone. So I grit my
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>teeth, holding my feelings in, and lift my elbows... To perform
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>this score, I asked several women to hold me down so that I
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>couldn’t get up. How real this &quot;game” became. Despite the resis
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tance, I was stubbornly determined to stand up. I couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>(wouldn’t) let any sound out, let anyone know how I was feeling.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The others’ taunts hurt me —&quot;how constipated she is,&quot; “you don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>want to take up our time,&quot; etc., etc. — but the hurt remained
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>bottled up inside. Sure, I might have simply told the others to
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>stop at any time, but (psychologically) I couldn’t. And I reflect on
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Anna’s insistence that dance is a direct expression of one’s life.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>That the same emotional blocks that restrict our everyday func
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>tioning also limit our movement.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>I have people clearly looking at their old dance, con
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>fronting it and accepting what it is and by dancing it,
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>experiencing that it is not working. Once this has hap
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>pened, all that vital energy locked up in the old dance is
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>rechanneled as energy and motivation to be used in
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>creating a new one.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>After two days of separation, the women and men came
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>back together. Each group presented its experience to the other.
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>The women chose to perform in a redwood grove. First we
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>sketched out a collective score, each of us offering suggestions as
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the plan took shape. The atmosphere of our setting was compel
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ling ... the silence, the needle floor muffling every footstep. We
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>decided to make that silence the core of our dance — no words, no
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>sound. Other elements impressed us. We noted the trees towering
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>upright, the light softly filtering through, the sacredness, the
				<lb facs='#facs_16_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>timelessness of the place. We wanted to merge with this environ-
			</p>
			<pb n='17'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ment without invading it, to recognize and respect its power as
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>part of ourselves. And we wanted to convey what the two days of
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>being together had meant to us, how our experience as a group
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>had strengthened us as individuals.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>We began our performance separated, each woman dancing
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>her self in relation to the surroundings. I snuggled myself inside a
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tree stump, needing enclosure within the vastness around me. I
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>couldn’t see the others. Yet I felt their presence, I felt joined in
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>experience to them. And 1 became more confident; 1 rose to meet
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the trees, standing straight and tall. My hands reached out to
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>clasp Alice’s. We walked toward each other, slowly, silently,
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>deliberately. Other women too began to approach each other,
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>linking hand to hand. Soon we formed a chain, and we wended
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>our way, step by step, downhill. At one moment we paused.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Sylvia stood alone, below us, sunlit on the dust-covered road.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>She just stood there ... silent, still, the only movement the rising
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and falling of her chest as she breathed in and out. That was her
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>dance. And her dance spoke to all of our experiences. A sense of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>inner strength, not assertive, just present. An inner rhythm, in
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tune with, part of the world around. An openness both expand
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ing, filling the space, and taking in, absorbing the space. One.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The men’s dance was totally different. I find myself resorting
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to clichés. The men performed in a cove at the bottom of a sharp
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cliff, where the sea battled the rocks. The women watched from
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>above. Each man stood isolated on his own rock. Each was cos
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tumed according to his self-image. Arthur posed erect, legs firmly
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>astride, a warrior, face painted, high above on the tallest rock.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Lower down, on another rock, Jamie writhed, moaning and
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>shrieking, shaking his seaweed hair. Each man did a specific
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>movement which the others then imitated. A male “chorus.&quot; Each
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>note sounded, then echoed back in differing tones as each man
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>adapted the movement to his own body. The shouts, the power
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>flung amidst the waves pounding rocks. The aggressiveness, the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>&quot;maleness&quot; struck me.
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>One by one, the men disappeared around a corner. Arthur
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>jerked his rattle in a frenzied dance, Jamie plunged into the icy
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>water to swim away. We could only hear the triumphant cries of
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the tribe gathering. Then they reappeared, to enact a healing
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ritual. How different from the women’s ceremony with Meg and
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Marlo. The men danced around each other, they seemed to avoid
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>touching each other. Their gestures were bound; less gentle, less
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>direct than ours had been; their mutual support less overt. And
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>then they invited us down to the rocks to be healed. To be healed
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>by the men? Was this really a meeting, equal to equal?
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>I still wonder that so many women went down. The atmos-
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>phere created by the men’s dance was alien, alien to me as a
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>woman. To go down was to enter a territory already staked out
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>on their terms. Again the stereotypes. And yet ... What I had
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>felt among the women was our shared strength, each of us rein
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>forcing the other — not so much through isolated echoes, as in the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>men’s dance, more in harmony. We were less insistent on an indi
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>vidualistic integrity. The men seemed afraid of each other, afraid
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to let their bodies mingle, afraid to touch. An aggregate of domi
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>nant notes rather than a true chorus. (Some people have thought
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that the difference I sensed was because I was an observer of the
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>men and a participant with the women. I don’t think so. In later
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>discussions, the men admitted how difficult it had been for them
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>to come together as a group, how hard it had been to relate physi
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>cally, to get close to each other.)

				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>She chooses for illustration how people sit in public places. &quot;Men
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>expanded into available space. They sprawled, or they sat with
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>spread legs.... Women condensed.... Women sat protectively
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>using elbows not to dominate space, not to mark territory, but to
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>protect their soft tissues.”” And I wonder again about the ways
				<lb facs='#facs_17_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women have been taught to hold their bodies.

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>movement. All of them believed that
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>women as a group are oppressed, handi

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ment, all of them had experience in con
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>sciousness-raising groups. Most of them
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>chose to see me primarily because l am a
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>woman, being fairly convinced that a

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>more understanding, that she would be
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>less biased than a man, or simply that

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>I have been struck by the differences be

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>And perhaps even more important, 1 have

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>that non-feminists have avoided. Let me
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>briefly explain. Since feminists seek
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>changes in others as well as in themselves,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>they develop more interpersonal skills
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and an ever-increasing sense of self. They
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>are less afraid of their aggressive impulses
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>— in particular, anger. They question the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>requests and expectations of others. Femi
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>nists do not dislike their sex and have dis

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>by defining, protecting and defending
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>their own needs, establishing their own
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>goals and directions, with increasing trust
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>in their own perceptions, judgment and

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>of the healthy adult, although feminists

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>My observations are based on a study
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>of 60 women —32 non-feminists and 28

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tion was implicit in the statements of most

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>coherent way to explain them, and saw
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>these symptoms as something in them
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>selves that needed correction or change. A

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>but on further inquiry it became clear that

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>that would automatically &quot;dissolve&quot; their

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>critical of others, while they downgraded
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>their own perceptions and feelings, as if
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>they doubted their validity. Their emo
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tional responses tended to be limited to
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the expression of sadness, desolation,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pain, very frequently accompanied by
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>crying.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Passive self-references predominated.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>The non-feminist often responded to

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>striking, that I began to pay attention to

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>from that of the non-feminists. The femi
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>nists were more selective in their choice of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>therapist, more critical of his/her views,

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>their pain and discomfort, they rejected
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>symptomatic treatments. Drugs and

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>contrasted with the pliable, unassuming,

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>in the beginning of therapy.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>The non-feminists often portrayed the

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>have great difficulty voicing their anger,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>particularly toward those upon whom
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>they were dependent financially or other

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>acknowledgment of anger was followed
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>by guilt, self-incrimination and doubts
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>about their femininity. These women ap

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>partners, was frequently subdued,

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ness&quot; of their own “demandingness&quot; or
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>unreasonable dissatisfaction. The listener
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>was, however, simultaneously briefed
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>about these men’s demanding attitude,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>their insensitivity, exploitation and other
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>blatantly hostile behaviors, as if the pa

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>feelings by having the therapist voice
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>them first.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Anger was more freely expressed
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>toward other women. The non-feminists
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>tended to see other women as shallow,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>empty-headed, jealous and untrust
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>worthy. Aside from one or two excep
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>tional&quot; female friends, these women seem
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>ed to believe that women (themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>included) were justifiable targets of con
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tempt, tending toward envy, selfishness
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>and manipulativeness. They thus found
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>themselves isolated from other women
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>and considered their company uninterest
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ing and unsatisfactory. While they did not
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>voice such feeling in relation to me, when
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>questioned they did state that they were
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>concerned about having a female thera

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ploration, it became clear that they had
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>mixed feelings. They felt freer speaking to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>a woman, but this was partly due to their
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>low esteem for women. They clearly felt
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>that the important judges of their worth
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>and attractiveness were men and that it
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>mattered much less whether a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>found them satisfactory. My status as a
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>psychiatrist did, however, tip the scales to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the other side. Their tendency to respect
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>my role as an &quot;expert&quot; and to trust my
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>opinion somewhat uncritically was in line
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>with their tendency to respect &quot;authority
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>(particularly malelike authority) and their

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>My initial ideas for this project con

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>40 pounds has a different energy than in

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N027'/>instinct. External circumstances, such as
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N028'/>economic constrictions, are major factors
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N029'/>in occupation of space, so 1 have selected

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N031'/>tional and cultural backgrounds. There is

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N033'/>macy, as my subjects range from my
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N034'/>mother and sister to total strangers. I am
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N035'/>documenting a lesbian couple because
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N036'/>women living openly with other women
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N037'/>in love/sexual relationships is one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N038'/>important recent changes in women’s life
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N039'/>styles. I had thought about documenting a
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N040'/>transsexual and a pair of identical twins,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N041'/>but I finally decided that such unique
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N042'/>situations emphasized the anomalies and
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N043'/>detracted from exploring the essentials of
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N044'/>body, space and personal ritual. I always
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N045'/>ask, &quot;Why do you want to be docu-
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N046'/>mented?&quot; The answers often contain vital

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ritual and body movement. For instance,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>many feminists have approached me, but
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>1 want to document women’s space, not

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Two events have been significant in my
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>use and understanding of my own space
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>since I began this project. First I painted
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>my bathroom and then I moved from my
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>500-square-foot home to a new apartment
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>with 1200 square feet, which I trans
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>formed into a fantasy of space that I had
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>had for a long time —large, empty, quiet,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>low stimulation. The second event was
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>being hospitalized for ten days with a
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>serious pelvic infection. I was given a little
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tray with powder, cream, toothbrush,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>toothpaste, mouthwash and cup. Nurses
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and doctors took over the care of my
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>body, which was so much a part of my
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>personal ritual. I adapted to this external
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>ly imposed space, but as I recovered, I
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>began to reassert my control over my per
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>sonal ritual. When I shared a room, it was
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>with a very sick woman who had cancer. I
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>observed what happens when the disinte
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>gration of a person’s body breaks down
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>her ability to control her own space and
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ritual. I listened to the nurses and doctors
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>repeating how good she smelled from
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>baby powder. I began to think about this
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and what happens in prisons, mental
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>institutions, hospitals, nursing homes,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>dormitories, the army. I thought about
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>how a person maintains her personal
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>ritual or utilizes space in such involuntary
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>circumstances, what a woman takes with
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>her to such places.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>My project is primarily concerned with
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>how a person takes up space, whether or
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>not she seems to fill a room, how her use
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>of space relates to that of her husband,
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>children or roommates. I had trouble
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>understanding one woman who seemed
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>perfectly at ease with her body; perhaps it
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>was just that which lessened her need to
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>order or definitively affect external space.

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Some people don’t make good subjects be
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>cause their lives are too much in flux or
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>too disintegrated. With others it is hard to
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>separate what the subject believes to be
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>true from what I observe.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>It is important to me that the subject
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>really understand what the project is
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>about on her own terms. I have to feel
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>comfortable with my subjects, to feel that
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>I am not intruding too much. What they
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>do and don’t want photographed is infor

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>see. Concealment is a delicate issue l’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>thought about a lot. The project is really
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>about disclosure, about how much a
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>woman is able to disclose to the artist. As
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>soon as the camera comes in, there is in
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>evitably a certain amount of playacting. I
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>have to understand that, and at the same
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>time minimize my presence to get as real a
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>picture as possible of everyday ritual and
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>space.
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>The key to personal ritual is found in
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>different places for different women. It
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>may appear in the areas to which a
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>woman devotes the most energy during
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the day. And yet a dirty kitty-litter box
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>may say something more important — or
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>plants (when they are watered or moved
				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>into the sunlight), or the humidifier (the

				<lb facs='#facs_21_r_5_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>important. In one case the care and time

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Sheepscot River, short and wide, a tidal estuary, comes to an end in a stony brook and then goes underground. The term
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tidal wave is loosely applied. Some rivers braid long plaits of sand with thinning streams, and others — always full, muddy
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>and sated — lag in fat banks. Tides are most marked when the sun is nearest the earth. Tides thigh tickling, oozing over the
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>edges and hummocks, a band of foam, making liquid land. Creeps up me toward immersion. Hold your waters. Making

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>brilliant pink feathers wet but still light, raised above the water in a tangle of wings. The end of the beach is distant; all
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>sand, no rocks or trees in sight. My swimming is leisurely but purposeful. In another dream I wake alone and rush to find
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>my lover. He is in the bathtub and I yell desperately at him: Did I sleep alone last night? Did I sleep alone last night?

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>length of the trip, not tired so much as a little bored. Once again the water is tepid, body temperature, lulling. The light-

				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>stained pink affecting everything below above. Doesn’t hold water, that’s all. Divers ring their bells but fail to reach us,
				<lb facs='#facs_26_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>cannot pierce the bubbles that contain them. And we are already down there, friendly, calm, constructing small places in

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Dear Jacki Apple —... When I read the c. 7,500 catalogue I was
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>overjoyed to find that I am working alongside of a great many
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>other women, especially you. 1 am enclosing a resume, a descrip

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to peruse. Also a photograph of me invading homosexual con

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the camera I don’t feel particularly male or homosexual or what
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ever; the identity shock comes when I look at the photographs of
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>myself in those roles. I am considering an actual invasion of
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>another identity: being picked up on Halifax waterfront as a
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>prostitute. That would involve real risk. I don’t think I would be
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>able to forget who I am, though, in spite of the immersion. To
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>lose myself was my original intent, I think, in December of 1971.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Also I used to worry about audience verification of my success a

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>using a tape recorder, and I found that the intellectual process of

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>wanting to taste everything. She is full of curiosity and hunger,

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>I liked her immensely. I also recognize something of myself
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>in her, younger. The energy, independence, restlessness; the

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>ing out life. I liked her optimism. She has a quality of motion and
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>sunshine, and underneath a vulnerability. I hope we will be able
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>to expand the relationship, write to each other, even make the

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>from the hour we spent together feeling it was much too brief,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>that we were like two people at a banquet wanting to taste every-

				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>stimulated and looking forward to corresponding. Part of my
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>excitement was in discovering another artist, a woman artist,
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>working with concepts similar to my own, and with the attitude
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>of experimentation which is so important to me. Another part of
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>it was your own personal openness and energy and curiosity.
				<lb facs='#facs_45_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The day your postcard arrived I had gone to the c. 7,500

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Soho—guarded, competitive, assessing each other, vying for
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>position, not interacting. When we have a chance to do things
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>differently, because we’ve never been in this position before, I
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>hate to see us blow it.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Right now 1 am working on some new pieces and I am con
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>cerned about pushing myself to the next stage, not doing thinge
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>which are repetitive. Yet I also think it is important to work
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>things through, not be precious, risk losing it, experiment on
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>several levels at one time.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I am interested in how a person changes his/her perception
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of him/herself through both self redefinition and definition by
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>others. Right now I am considering a piece which will involve a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>person, then a group, experiencing then reexperiencing them
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>selves through their color aura, their self-color, and then their
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>alien color...
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>I would like to hear more about the piece you are doing
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>about the “chemistry of camera presence&quot; as it is something that
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>has been both a concern and a conflict for me. Do you plan to do
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>the same piece twice, with and without a camera, and see how
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>they differ?...
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Would you be interested in doing a piece with me? Some
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>thoughts, possibilities: (1) Both of us doing the same piece sepa
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>rately. (2) Exchanging pieces and carrying out each other’s pieces,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>then doing our own. Showing the four interpretations. (3)
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Perhaps doing my &quot;Identity Exchange” piece together as we are of
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>similar coloring, size, and sign. I have never performed this piece
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>myself. It was enacted by Geoff Hendricks in February 1972 at
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Rutgers University. If you plan to be in NY we could do it as a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>one-day event. (Like a Saturday in Soho—unofficial use of
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>galleries!)
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>l’ve been taking ballet classes twice a week now since the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>beginning of July, and it is changing my body awareness. It
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>makes me think about movement pieces. It would be good to
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>work with a dance group.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Write and let me know what you are doing and thinking. I
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>am looking forward to hearing more about the pieces you men
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>tioned in your card, and everything else going on in your life. Let
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>me know when you plan to be in New York again, and hopefully
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>we will be able to spend more time together. I will take a day off.

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Dear Jacki — Your letter put adrenalin back into my blood. Actu
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ally, l’m an avid letter writer, but I hesitate to write copious
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>letters to non-writers or post-carders; now 1 have an excuse.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Did I tell you about my &quot;value scale,&quot; composed of colors
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>that have emotional value for me? When I read the part of your
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>letter about &quot;color aura” I started glumping around my empty
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>kitchen making soft exclamatory noises. Friday l’m going to a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>paper company downtown to get a sheet each of high-intensity
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>orange, blue, red and green, the colors that represent the four
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>points on my emotional compass. I was thinking of making call
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ing-card-sized chips of color to place before me as I confront a
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>(stranger? Haven’t worked this out yet) during a ten-minute inter
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>val. The number and combination of chips would suggest the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tone of the confrontation (for me). As I explained in New York, I
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>used to worry about the content of my subjects&apos; consciousness,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>but it’s too hard to document it. On the other hand, for the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>&quot;Chemistry of Camera-Presence” piece, l’ve decided the only way
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to keep the element of surprise is for me to surprise other people
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>with a camera; since I am going to set up the piece, I would
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>always be aware of the possibility of being filmed. I want to blow
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>up the adjustment process as an individual realizes s/he is being
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>filmed. Also I want to do a piece next week on videotape record
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ing the time it takes me to act out an emotion. Method actors
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>recall certain images to make themselves cry, etc. l’m not as inter
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>ested in the tears as I am in the images. These will be written and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>read silently while l’m on camera (?). l’ve discovered that reading
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>out loud does not produce tears or whatever, and neither does
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>description into a mike; the intellectual process cancels the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>emotional experience. Silent fantasy is necessary. l’m wondering
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>what the camera will do to me, since l’m not an experienced
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>actor....
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Ihave been taking Graphoanalysis by correspondence, and I

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>grudges, are sympathetic, not too precise, but were pessimistic
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>when you wrote the letter. Oh, yes, very original, as indicated by
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>figure-8 &quot;g&quot; formations. I am typing because when I get excited,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>my handwriting becomes code.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Now for the facts: I plan to cut first term a week short and
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>come to NYC. If I came on, say, Monday the 3 of December,
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>could I stay with you through Saturday the 8th? We could use the
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>week to get together a performance in 420 West Broadway such
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>as &quot;Identity Exchange” or we could do our color pieces simul
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>taneously and trade off. I could do a reading of &quot;Routine Per
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>formance&quot; et al. in front of an audience instead of a video
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>camera; also l’ve been wanting to try out &quot;Body Images” on a live
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>audience. I hadn’t thought about it before, but perhaps I could do
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>&quot;Composure,&quot; the piece which was in the c. 7,500 show, in front
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>of an audience with the aid of a mirror.
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>I have been thinking about &quot;Identity Exchange&quot; and (don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>worry, I won’t tell you) I can’t help associating New York with
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>you. In your case, I think it is valid to associate place with char
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>acter; I just hope I don’t make you think of Mackerel....
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>l’d like to attend a women’s meeting in NYC; a group has
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>finally started meeting here, but for some reason I don’t feel close
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>to anyone as yet. l’m not trying to prove myself as strenuously as
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>I used to through my appearance, as they do. Appearance is stil
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>critical to me, but l’m settled now and they aren’t. Many of them
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>see me as a teacher (which of course I am to some of them) with
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>all the connotations of that position attached: wise, old, re

				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Dear Jacki—Richards met me at the airport; he and Marcia
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>arrived the day before. He guessed that I might sue him, and said
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>I would have to do it, but we reached an amicable peace even
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>tually. We sat in the car for an hour talking, and he ended up
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>saying that he couldn’t believe how strong I was. Last night 1
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>didn’t sleep at all and consequently felt rotten all day today, but
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>today I got an apartment which I can move into January 12th. 1
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>am envious of the way Richards looks at Marcia, but that&apos;s all. I
				<lb facs='#facs_46_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>don’t think Marcia is any shakes. She has this defense mecha

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>people looked at me as though I was a call girl, even though it
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>was 3:00 in the afternoon. Definition by circumstantial evidence.

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>could do the same?

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>twined in my life since December, and I ought to examine the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>events, and the complexities of feelings that have come out of
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>them. I am slightly antagonistic towards her today. Somewhat
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>resentful of her carelessness, her total self-absorption, the com
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>plete subjectivity of her way of dealing with things, always seeing
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>through her needs, never beyond them or around them. Perhaps
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>it is her youth, her limited experience. No matter. Combined with
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>all that intense hungry ambition and that fine sharp intellect, it
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>fills me with a vague sense of annoyance. I have been very gener
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ous with her, given of myself — my friends, my home, my
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>clothes, my time, my ideas, experiences, knowledge, my food,
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>my energy, and finally advice when asked for. I find her to be less
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>sharing. At first her sunshine smile, her eagerness, seemed so
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>unassuming. But her apologies are aggressive, and her assump
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>tions border on arrogance. Yet underneath there are still the self-
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>degrading gestures, the feelings of inadequacy, the fear. She is ful.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>of contradictions, inconsistencies. Overriding everything is the
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>impressive professionalism of her art.... Our relationship seems
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>to have gone around in a full circle. I think we will have to talk
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>about these things.

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Dear Martha —... Rereading your letter I get the feeling R. and
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>M. are really bugging you underneath the bravado. That is very
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>real, a painful fact you have to deal with daily. It’s understand
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>able. Hard to avoid them. Glad your friends are supportive.
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Don’t worry. As you’ve begun to discover, facades become reali
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ties, and it takes about six months and distance for a lover to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>become a stranger in your mind. Love, Jacki

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Jacki —... I got an assurance that our piece could be shown in
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the Mezzanine Gallery here at NSCAD, so I will take installation
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>photos when it’s up...
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I don’t talk to Richards anymore; we speak if we bump into
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>each other, but don’t seek each other out. l’m speaking to a
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>female lawyer on Tuesday and I may sue Richards if l’m legally
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>capable because he really did step on me. Otherwise l’m dating a
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>concert pianist who lives out in Hubbards. He now plays only to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>amuse himself and directs plays in experimental theatres and
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>prisons for his living. He knows l’m leaving in May. He says he
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>was first attracted by my independence. Men like that are hard to
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>come by....
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>I keep my social life full as possible so I don’t have to think
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>about being in Halifax near Richards, etc. l’m going to a shrink
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>who is sending me to relaxation therapy because I don’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>how to relax.... III let you know how the layout progresses.

				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Dear Martha —... There are a lot of things I want to get into in
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>relation to the really extraordinary experience that we’ve been
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>through. I don’t think either of us realized just how far we had
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>gone. We placed ourselves in the most vulnerable of positions. As
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>two strangers we entered into immediate and intense intimacy
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with total trust. We took an enormous gamble. It was very
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>daring of us. And I think we both suffered from aftereffects not
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>anticipated and not immediately perceived or understood. I don’t
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>have the time right now to explore this and I think in another
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>sense it is kind of another piece. Certainly the subject of another
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>part of our piece and worth investigating....
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>This weekend I worked up my “Brunette” piece. It’s turned
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>up some interesting surprises for me. Perhaps a subconscious
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>equation — Blonde-Female, Brunette-Male (hmmm......) in
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>relation to identity/image projection (mine).
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>Reading books on Archaeology for the Digging piece in
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>May. Fascinating. Also, l’m enjoying my privacy. Like being
				<lb facs='#facs_47_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>alone.

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>l’m very glad you called me that day as it cleared a lot of
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>conflicts and questions and complex mixed-up feelings all collid
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ing in my head. It relieved a few tensions, and I felt a release of
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>certain anxieties after talking. It was also good to talk with you as
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the extra dimension in voice clarifies the meaning in words so
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>often misread in print....
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Take care. Love, Jacki

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Dear Jacki —... It’s wonderful to hear about L’s interest in the
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>piece. It is so bleak up here, and New York gets more and more
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>frightening to contemplate from this distance. I keep questioning
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>whether I can survive as an artist and get worry wrinkles thinking
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Your letter was tremendously supportive. Today I do a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>videotape of making myself up first as beautiful and then as ugly
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>as I can. I have been thinking a lot about &quot;vomiting&quot; on people; 1
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>see this as playing a joke on myself.... Love, Martha

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Dear Martha —I wanted to write to you immediately, as soon as I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>got back from London, as I am bursting with things to tell you.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>That was two weeks ago, and my life has been in turmoil, so I am
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>beyond apologies....
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>First I want to tell you about the c. 7,500 show in London. 1
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>called Tony Stokes (at Garage Arts) when I arrived and he
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>seemed very relieved that I was there. On Saturday morning I
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>went down to Garage and then with the help of a terrific group of
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>London women artists I installed the show in the Warehouse next
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>door. It was a perfect space for the show. Very New York raw! 1
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>must say I did a fantastic job. Did two terrific walls for us, put
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>ting our work next to each other’s. Added the B&amp;W contact sheet
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>from “Transformance” with your article in the middle. It really
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>looked good....
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>I have been going through some fairly difficult changes and
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>conflicts. I long for my own psychic space, room to grow in, to
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>experience my art in. The time has run out for me to continue in
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the double life of full-time work (job) and full-time art. I am
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>exhausted, overstrained, and colliding with myself, struggling
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>with hostilities and overextension emotionally. I don’t have
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>enough time and I feel like l’m suffocating from spinning too
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>quickly and not being able to slow down to breathe deeply...
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Not having money is as paralyzing as not having time. They
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>equalize and neutralize each other. Besides, earning one’s own
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>money is part of both the real and psychological independence
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and liberation from the role of the woman-child. So I have to
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>search for alternative possibilities. This is especially difficult now
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>because the economy is a disaster area. There are no jobs any
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>where.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>I am at a point of change in my life, trying to create new
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>structures. The piece we did together was a culmination point for
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>me, the end of a cycle.... I find myself looking into another
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>mirror, seeing a different image.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>The DIGGING piece has become very complex and multi
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>layered. It is just a beginning now, and it might take months to
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>complete. The actual &quot;dig&quot; itself will take place in several weeks.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>When I think about it I get very excited, like someone about to
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>take a journey into unknown territory, like going to a foreign city
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>after having read a book about its history.... It will be good to
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>see you and sit and talk for hours.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Also it will be interesting to do a tape about the other part of
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>TRANSFORMANCE —what we experienced with each other,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>the risks we took, how far we went, how we reacted later, over-
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>reacted, then rebalanced; where we are now. We plunged into
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>each other’s lives off a high diving board. We went very deep,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>very quickly, and perhaps suffered the mild bends coming up for
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>air. It could be a very important tape to go with the piece. Also
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>maybe a photo of us today, six months later. Call me when you
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>get to New Jersey....

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>alone. She said R was unoriginal, I was the &quot;individual&quot; which
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>shocked me. She sees me as courageous, she said in her letter to
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>me, envies me. I love speed, it relieves the panic, the separation,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>substitutes euphoria, wholeness? I wish I could stay on it. Have
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>lost some double chin. Dinner tonight with R and Marcia. Sat

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tonight, tell him I am alone, afraid. He is my father substitute
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>because of his aloofness. I should be doing something all the time,

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>marriage to Marcia represents to me. I can’t do that now? Now
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>l’m in the kitchen and I feel lethargic, desperate, speechless,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>embarrassed, like being at home. I have to be intellectual around
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>him. Isnap at Damian, can’t play, indulge him. Had a dream that
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>I stayed in the room below them. I am a frustrated child and I

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>have to perform for him. He came in to ask what my plans were
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and for a split second I felt guilty? Not a barrel of fun to be with.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Have to learn to love myself, whatever that means. Art about

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>told me he was nearly out of a job. Apparently she is ambitious,

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>by male sensibility and value systems. Do too many women

				<lb facs='#facs_49_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>achieve power and position in the art world we charge forth into

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N005'/>is Anais Nin.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_52_l_1689' n='N001'/>Anais Nin is a writer. She was born in
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N002'/>1920 in Neuilly near Paris. When she was
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N003'/>eleven her father left her. He was a Span
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N004'/>ish pianist. Her mother, a Spanish dancer,
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N005'/>lived with her and her brother. When her
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N006'/>father left her she started writing a diary.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N007'/>It was really a letter to her father to try to
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N008'/>get him to come back to her.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N009'/>The family was living in Richmond Hill
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N010'/>in Queens and her father went to Paris to
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N011'/>become a famous pianist. She had even
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N012'/>actually sent him a letter, only her mother
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N013'/>didn’t mail it and said it had gotten lost in
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N014'/>the mail. When she was about 24 years
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N015'/>old she wrote some very beautiful poems
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N016'/>and stories but since she was a woman
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N017'/>(and there weren’t many women writers)
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N018'/>no one would publish her works. But
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N019'/>Anais Nin thought that they were good
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N020'/>enough to be published; so she set up a
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N021'/>printing press and she published all her
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N022'/>works herself. Since then they have be
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N023'/>come very famous.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N024'/>Anais Nin’s career started very late
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N025'/>and, still today, she is writing some of her
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N026'/>best novels and stories.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N027'/>Anais Nin is unlike most people. When
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N028'/>she dreams she wants these dreams to
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N029'/>come true. She says that dreams won&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N030'/>come to you. You have to make them
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N031'/>come true. Once she dreamed about a nice
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N032'/>big houseboat. Then she saw an ad for a
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N033'/>houseboat on the Seine in the newspaper.
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N034'/>She bought the houseboat and moved into

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>she became a Spanish dancer. (Since he
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>was a Spanish pianist she figured he could
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>play and she could dance.) She performed
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>in Paris under the name Anita Aguilera
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and even though she was a writer and was
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>doing it for her father, she was a very
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>good dancer.

				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>mail if she ever became famous. Even
				<lb facs='#facs_52_r_8_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>though she gets many letters each day

				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>A friend once told me about a feminist workshop in which each woman was asked to acknowledge her matrilineal ancestry by
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>repeating the phrase: &quot;I am the daughter of ...&quot; and then naming her mother. To everyone’s amazement, many of the women in that
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>small, randomly selected group spontaneously responded: “T am the daughter of Anais Nin.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>A major theme of the women’s movement has been that biology is not destiny. Therefore a doctor’s words to the youthful Anais are
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ironic: “You were not built for maternity.&quot; Instead of becoming a biological mother, Anais Nin was the spiritual mother to an entire
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>generation of women writers. As a biological mother and a feminist, I can think of no greater gift to my own children than a spiritual
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>parent. It was with this in mind that in 1974 I suggested that my ten-year-old, Claudia, contact Anais Nin.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>One of Anais’ recurring motifs has been the transcendence of loss through artistic creation. I wanted to share this motif with my
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>daughter. My husband and I had recently separated. I was teaching a college course on Anais Nin’s Diaries. I began to realize how very
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>much like my own children Anais had felt when her father left her at approximately the same age. Claudia’s English class project was to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>write the biography of a famous person. She had chosen Shakespeare, but was making little progress. It occurred to me that the painful
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>after-effects of her parents’ separation might be connected to this “writing block.&quot; But I found myself in the position of being unable to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>help her at the time she needed me precisely because I was her mother. The person my children missed most in the world was the person
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>against whom I harbored extremely bitter sentiments. I felt torn between my own anger and my children’s need for me to understand that
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>they still loved their father. I knew instinctively that Anais Nin, through the Diaries, could do the spiritual mothering I found impossible,
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>that reading about how she had used her own pain as a source óf creative energy might give Claudia confidence that childhood wounds
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>could be overcome.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>When I spoke to Claudia about Anais, she perked up and instantly switched her topic from Shakespeare to Nin. Then she wrote to
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Anais, telling her about the project and asking if there were any possibility of obtaining the childhood journal, written, as Anais tells us
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>&quot;as a diary of a journey to record everything for my father. It was written for him and I had really intended to send it to him. It was really
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>a letter so he could follow us into a strange land, know about us.&quot; Claudia included some of her own poetry with her letter and soon
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>received an enthusiastic response.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>If Anais Nin’s Diaries can speak personally to a child of ten, it is because Nin herself has never lost sight of the child she was. It is this
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>intermingling of past, present and future that gives the Diaries their universal and timeless ap peal for the young and old alike. She says in
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the fourth Diary: “We live back and forth in the past or in the present or in the future. With the young one lives in the future. I prefer
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>that. Changes occur constantly according to the vision, image or myth that possesses one..... We never discard our childhood. We
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>never escape it completely ... The young’s attraction for the old is the protection of their future. The need of faith and the elder’s vision
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>into the future.&quot; If, as Anais states, “changes occur according to the myth we are possessed by,” it is no wonder that those who read the
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Diaries and become possessed by the myth of transcendence through creation undergo the therapeutic effects of a transpersonal healing. It
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>was precisely this faith in the future and the elder’s vision that I wanted to pass on to my daughter and that caused just such a psychic
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>healing to take place.
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>I think Claudia was helped most in handling that difficult period in her life by the knowledge she gained from Anaïs that reality need
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>not only be composed of what you live, but more importantly of what you dream, and that the creation of the Marvelous in life is no
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>denied those who experience loss or pain, as long as the creative will prevails and transforms that suffering. Of all the papers I have reac
				<lb facs='#facs_53_r_23_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>on Ai.aïs Nin, none has moved me more than the very simple project written by my own daughter.

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Even though in 1790 the Constituent Assembly introduced a

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Napoleon’s “Civil Code” of 1804 stated outright: “A wife owes

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>In spite of the setbacks, women had perceived the possibilities
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>for freedom. Soon after the turn of the century the social utopians
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>appeared before the public with plans for a new social order.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Searching for a new identity and lacking their own theories,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>women believed they had finally found their place in Saint
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Simon’s Association universelle. Here man and woman would
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>form the future “social unit&quot; in a structure free of all enslavement.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>However, Saint-Simon himself provided only general formula
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>tions. The exegesis of his gospel was left to his apostle Père
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Enfantin.* And Enfantin again placed woman on the very throne
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that had always stood in the way of her liberation: she became an
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ideal figure to be worshipped. Enfantin and his numerous fol
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>lowers, men and women of all classes, awaited the appearance of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the Mère—the female messiah who, with the Père, was supposed
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to form the Saint-Simonian papal couple, the “Divine Andro
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>gyne.&quot; This &quot;Mother&quot; was also supposed to break the &quot;seal&quot; on
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the shackles of women. But despite an intensive search, which
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>included expeditions to the Orient, this worthy woman was never
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>found. The seal on women’s chains remained.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Enfantin loosened one bond, however, with his réhabilitation
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>de la chair—the &quot;liberation of the flesh&quot; from the bonds of Chris
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>tianity’s aversion to the carnal. This meant the moral relaxation of
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the bonds of marriage to the very boundaries of promiscuity and
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>was first perceived by Saint-Simonian women as progressive.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>However, it proved to be neither a theoretical nor a practical step
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>toward their liberation. The dualism of body and soul was main
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tained. Woman continued to be flesh, but her corporeality was
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>elevated as a means of dignifying the male spirit. By making the
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>body divine, woman could be sexually exploited that much more
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>easily. In addition, no women sat in Enfantin’s Conseil suprême,
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and in 1851 they were completely excluded from the hierarchy.
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>A great many women learned a lesson from these disappoint

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Yet women were not in a position to create an autonomous

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Flora Tristan, for example, led a lifelong battle for the cause of
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>women and workers because of the dual oppression she had her
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>self experienced. After the early death of her father she went to
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>work as an illuminator. Her youthful marriage to her employer
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>was unhappy; Tristan left her husband and took her children
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>with her. According to the law at that time the marriage could
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>not be dissolved and the husband was able to persecute his wife
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>for many years without punishment.“
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Tristan’s major work, The Union of Labor, appeared in 1843,
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>shortly before her death. Long before Marx she proposed and ex
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>pounded her idea that although the emancipation of workers must
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>be achieved by the workers themselves, it would only remain an
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>illusion without the emancipation of women. Tristan also sug
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>gested to the workers the text for a declaration which ends, “We,

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>so-called social novels written after 1840. She made farmers and

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>classes from 1830 to 1850. Her opinions placed her in the left wing
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>of the petit bourgeois democrats.
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>As for the women’s question, Sand—like Leroux—did not ex

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>it is not only because of this blind faith in automatic change that
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the women’s question is peripheral in her “social” novels. From
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>her extensive work with society and politics she could have come
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to a clearer analysis of the present and future role of women in
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>society. But Sand was no longer concerned with the women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>question. Having been accepted as one of their own by the most
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>influential men of her time, she believed she had attained eman
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>cipation and was, indeed, already beyond it. She had become a
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>man out of conviction and had nothing but contempt for her
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>former sex. Thus even in 1848 she disassociated herself very
				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>clearly from the women’s rightists.

				<lb facs='#facs_55_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>simply as the imitation and exchange of sexual roles. She dressed

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to delivery. One quarter of the profit was paid out in wages, one

				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>went back into production.” Finally, in August 1848, Deroin
				<lb facs='#facs_57_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>founded a central French labor union movement. In answer to her

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>des femmes had to cease publication. These measures were based
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>on a decree by the Assemblée, which was initially worded:
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;Women and minors may not be members of a club nor attend
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>club meetings.&quot; After protests against the defamatory way in

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>were eliminated from the decree, but the ban against women

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>George Sand was also suggested and rejected as a candidate.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Again she demonstrated that she did not think of herself as a

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>for members of her own sex. In Sand’s view women were political

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and America were also divided on this issue. Some saw the vote
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>as leading to further reforms for women, while others saw it as
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>leading to socialism. Today, reformist politics tactically in

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>with attempts by radical feminists to rethink society and rela
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tionships within society. In the criticism of power, bureaucracy

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>—feminists have proved, consciously or not, to be anarchists.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The anarchist premise of radical feminism is that only
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>through collectivity and equality can individuality, autonomy
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>and independence be achieved. Individuality, in this sense, means
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>something like &quot;personal and interpersonal realization.&quot; This is

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>class analysis doesn’t provide a basis for further organization.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Anarchist egalitarianism in women’s groups has been based not
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>only on political, but on ethical or moral grounds which presume
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>that women should behave in a certain way—openly, honestly,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>with integrity. Women, by requiring this of each other, some
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>times create a feeling of moral superiority over men who, by
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>implication, and often in fact, are not honest among themselves,

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Historically, ethical and egalitarian relationships among
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>women did not result only from choice, as was the case with
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>anarchists, but from material conditions excluding women from
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>full participation in production and power—and thus from the

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>equality, which often made democracy intrinsic to organization.
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Because woman’s domain was traditionally more personal,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>women’s political activities tended to center around personal
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>questions. (Sheila Rowbotham suggests that this focus is a

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>oppression, often bogs down in the attempt to reconcile morality
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>with revolutionary strategy. The impetus behind a moral position
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>is more often rational than revolutionary; it is a call to reason, to
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the recognition of how things should be and the decision to make
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>them that way. But the idea that change is effected only by reason
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and understanding can be utopian and/or reactionary, since
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>recognition of class and economic contradictions alone cannot
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>affect the power relationships behind these conflicts. On the other

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>how can the content of change be maintained within a confusion
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>about form? What organizational form will work without sacri

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>that is not utopian—has been anarchism’s traditional dilemma as

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>cated on a moral-philosophical belief in a &quot;natural&quot; social state
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>without government or male-created institutions—a condition
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>that would be “naturally” reinstated if government or male
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>institutions were abolished; that is, Nature herself, or women,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>would produce a better social organism.

				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>aspects of women’s groups. It must be kept in mind, however,
				<lb facs='#facs_73_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>that anarchists and feminists have often reached the same con

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>This meant reorganization through federalism, nations broken
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>down into small autonomous units. Psychological pressure
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>would replace force, for people would have to be honest and
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>virtuous in face-to-face confrontations. Small discussion groups
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>would encourage the pursuit of knowledge, extending laterally to

				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>The major impetus of consciousness raising has been
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Godwinian, centering around discussion and inquiry with trust,
				<lb facs='#facs_74_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>loyalty and honesty as criteria for respect. According to the Red

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and her advocation of the mass strike were replete with anarchist
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>assumptions. Though she was, in fact, strongly opposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>anarchism in any form, in relation to Lenin&apos;s authoritarian

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>complexities of struggle. While her goal was the same as Lenin’s
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the destruction of capitalism by the working class—she believed
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>in creative improvisation of leadership rather than in precisely
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>planned strategies. She did, of course, believe in leadership, but
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>considered good organization the product of action rather than
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>its precedent and saw organization as growing out of struggle.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>While Luxemburg understood the necessity of centralism as a

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>decides for all. 2. The rigorous separation of the organized
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>nucleus from its social-revolutionary surroundings. . . .&quot; The
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>German Social Democracy, she insisted, was not joined to the

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with the masses; it was to provide the &quot;spirit of movement&quot; to the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>masses. Luxemburg objected that the power of the Central
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Committee would be comprehensible only if it took the initiative
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of a &quot;vast revolutionary act,&quot; paralleling Goldman’s means-ends
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>argument.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Luxemburg saw the development of class consciousness as a
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>product of the frictions between the party and trade union
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>activity. Lenin, denying this dialectical function, saw trade union
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>activity as a mere reflection of bourgeois consciousness in the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>working class. Through her belief that continued agitation was
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the only way to prevent the retardation of the struggle, Luxem
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>burg supported the traditionally anarchist idea of the mass strike.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>&quot;Spontaneity, as she used the term, meant action as opposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>static or reformist attitudes; it was misinterpreted by the Bolshe
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>viks to mean confusion or to suggest that the party’s rational
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>policies should be determined by the &quot;spontaneous” desires of the
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>masses. “But what has been the experience of the Russian socialist

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>changes have not been the inventions of several leaders and even

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>been the spontaneous product of the movement in ferment.&quot; The
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tactical policy of social democracy was not &quot;invented” but was
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>the &quot;product of a series of great creative acts.&quot; Luxemburg argued
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>that Lenin’s was not a “positive and creative spirit,” that he tried
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to &quot;narrow the movement rather than to develop it, to bind i
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>rather than to unify it....For us it is not the letter but the

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>that she seems closest to anarchism. She wanted to replace systen

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>dynamism.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Clara Zetkin, a close friend of Luxemburg, agreed with most
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>of her ideas. However, Zetkin was a feminist, working for wom

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>tariat&quot;1), and she believed that economic independence through
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>socially productive labor was the key to women’s freedom.
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Because of this, she thought at first that the destruction of private

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>love, understanding, and respect.“1 But like Goldman, Zetkin
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>later recognized the difference between the role of women’s rights
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>for bourgeois women and for working-class women. Middle-class
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>women could focus on issues of personal liberation and more
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>individual concerns, while working-class women, exploited as
				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>women and as workers, did not have that kind of leisure. Because

				<lb facs='#facs_76_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>of women. Because of her feminism, Zetkin was victimized by the

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>appeared in Mujeres Libres. The organization developed into

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>kitchens and the organized collection of food, but mainly they

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>social and personal institutions. They set up day-care centers in

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>social liberation.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Federica Montseny, under whose influence many of these

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>hon, she was also influenced by the individualist anarchism of
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Stirner, Neitzsche and Ibsen, which stressed personal autonomy.
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>While she approved the &quot;egoism&quot; of this position, Montseny re
				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>jected its often aristocratic tendency, arguing that the dialectical

				<lb facs='#facs_78_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>seny’s idea of revolution was that it had to be social, not political,

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>enced communism. Anarchist and feminist emphasis is on the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>quality of life, on the basic structures of community, family and
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>education. Many anarchist attitudes are seen as culturally female
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>— the emphasis on intuition, instinct, feeling and spontaneity, the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>distrust of logic as authoritarian and dominating. While anarch
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>ism has directed its argument against government, women have
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>fought against patriarchy as such, private as well as public. It
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>may be that this rebellion against all patriarchal institutions is
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>what has led women into anarchist positions. Paralleling a retro

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>try (non-syndicalist anarchism) is that retrograde feminism that
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sees freedom only in liberation from men (separatism). As the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Spanish experience of feminism shows, permanent liberation
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>depends upon a total social structure. Sexism must be fought as

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>plained without it, but it must always be recalled that feminism is
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>only part of the primary focus on class contradiction. The history
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of the socialist struggle in Russia and China, of feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>anarchism, and even of the Weather Underground, shows how

				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>exaggerated by male habits of dominance.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Anarchist tendencies in feminism could come from two
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>sources. The first is the concept that women are &quot;naturally” more
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>anarchistic because woman’s “nature&quot; is closer to the earth, to the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>anarchist idea of the &quot;natural state.&quot; The second possibility is his
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>torical and cultural. Women have been excluded from full par
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>ticipation in government and industry, and have been confined to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the smaller, more immediate contexts of family and community
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>where harmony and cooperation are desirable and important.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Because talk, gossip and expressing emotion were for so long the
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>only expressions permitted women, direct contact in small groups
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>seemed appropriate and necessary for the beginning of social
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>transformation. But there have always been at least two women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>movements. The middle-class movement, historically originating
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>from the free time and the good education that permit women to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>rebel against the emptiness of their leisure and the absurdity of
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>female roles, has been able to concentrate on issues of personal
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>ity, personal freedom, structures of language and art, social inter
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>action and individual response to conditions of oppression. More
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>recently, middle-class women have been able to work in small
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>groups in an attempt to build up mutual confidence. The work
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>ing-class women’s movement, on the other hand, has sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>been invisible because it has been aligned with socialist struggles
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and unionism. For these women, oppressed by class as well as by
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>sexism, feminism is not usually the primary strategy; they seek
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>more immediate changes, tied to conditions in the working place,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>and often ignore their extension in the home. While their de
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>mands are often feminist —for equal pay, pay during maternity
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>leave, day-care centers —these are sought within sexually inte
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>grated contexts. The task now seems to bring these two feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>movements together.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Anarchism presents an unresolvable contradiction. How can
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>it be achieved in a world where everything is leading toward
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>greater centralization? As soon as anarchists begin to build prac
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tical systems, they are forced to approach a more centralized
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>communism through the necessity for concentration of capital.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>But in spite of this contradiction, anarchism is important, par
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ticularly to women. Perhaps it can’t be put into effect unless allied
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>with another system (socialism, communism); perhaps it has to
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>serve as a constant criticism of authoritarianism, bureaucracy,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>paternalism, protesting the erosion or obfuscation of liberty. Its
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>role may be to serve as a moral reminder that social change is,
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and always should be, for people.
				<lb facs='#facs_79_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>There is a lesson in all of this: if in the entire history of

				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>In August 1976, there emerged in Belfast, Northern Ireland
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>apparently quite &quot;spontaneously,” a movement, which althougl
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>it was later to be dubbed “The People for Peace” movement, was
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>quite without a doubt a women’s movement, initiated, supported
				<lb facs='#facs_80_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and sustained primarily by women. From the perspective of cla

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the British introduced internment. Another movement sprang up
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>in Derry in 1972. After a British soldier had killed a Catholic

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Peace and Freedom, headed by Jane Addams, sent their own
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>commission to study Irish self-rule, clearly opposing the interests
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of their own government. The Irish section of the WILPF, led by
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Louie Bennett, was active in organizing women to employ
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>passive-resistance techniques in a struggle against the British.
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Their view as women was that human life was precious and that

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The peace movement, as Bernadette Devlin has pointed out,
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>is not a feminist movement. There is in fact virtually no feminism

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>While there have been several notable female political activists in

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>lag far behind not only those of men, but behind those of most
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>European women as well. While the legal status of Ulster women
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>is superior to that of women in the Catholic Republic of Ireland
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>where women still have almost no independent legal rights, a

				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and Northern Irish women are for the most part still politically
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>subservient to their husbands as well as being educationally and
				<lb facs='#facs_83_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>economically disadvantaged. While these conditions can ulti

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>we look for it. If people can’t see behind the facade to

				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>When Marin de Burca speaks of working in a political way
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to unite Catholics and Protestants, she is speaking as a marxist
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>attempting to organize working people to assume greater econo
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>mic control. While, as a member of the Official IRA, de Burca
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>definitely supports an anti-imperialist struggle, she feels that in
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the long run the sectarian disputes dividing the Catholic and Prot-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>estant working populations are perhaps an even greater obstacle
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>to the struggle for self-determination. As the situation exists now,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>separate Catholic and Protestant labor unions render the labor
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>movement as a whole relatively ineffectual, and continued eco
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>nomic disintegration due to sectarian violence has left large sec
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>tions of the Catholic and Protestant population unemployed.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>It is interesting to note the difference between de Burca&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>marxist analysis, which views the entire Irish working class as the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>oppressed class and the type of marxist analysis supported by
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>other Republicans, which views the Catholic minority in the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>North as the oppressed class. The Provisionals, who are not nec
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>essarily socialists but prefer to think of themselves as consistently
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>on the left, persist in opposing both the British and the Protestan
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>paramilitary and are engaged in a constant struggle for unifica
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>tion with the Catholic South. Bernadette Devlin, a socialist and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>an aggressive Republican, generally supports this form of analysis
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>where class—purely in economic terms—is secondary to anti
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>imperialism and a class analysis stressing the political and eco
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>nomic discrimination that the Catholic population as a whole has
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>suffered at the hands of a Protestant-controlled government and
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>industry.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>The complexity of the situation and the relative inadequacy
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of this approach is apparent when one considers, even in crude
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>terms, the economic composition of the Catholic and Protestant
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>population. While it is definitely true that the Protestant majori-
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>ty, as a group, has greater economic control, and that the high
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>est levels of unemployment in the North are in Catholic districts,
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the large majority of the Protestant population is also working
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>class. It is, in fact, the youths of these two communities who are
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>fighting one another, while the small minority of Protestants who
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>are wealthy maintain an economic advantage and have an inter
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>est in continuing sectarian hostilities for precisely this reason.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>It would be a mistake, however, to attempt to evaluate the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>significance of the peace movement on the basis of its potential
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>effectiveness in furthering the cause of other political movements.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>It is perhaps more useful to consider the way in which the peace
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>movement is indicative of an entirely different struggle for self
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>determination, as well as a profoundly different approach to these
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>issues. It is significant that what is being questioned by the peace
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>people is not the ends of political struggle so much as the means
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>by which ideas, opinions and interests are both culturally rein
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>forced and socially imposed.
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>The critical issue which is the historical source of internal
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Irish conflict is that of the relationship between Ireland and the
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>British Empire. This has not only kept Catholics and Protestants
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>feuding for generations, but has also led to innumerable splits
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>within both camps. It is paradoxical that within this contex
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>British imperialism is the one issue on which the peace campaign
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>has most consistently refused to take a stand. This is not because
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>individual participants have no opinions on this question, but
				<lb facs='#facs_84_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>rather because the movement locates the &quot;solution” in people, in

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>itarian in its very mode of thought.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Problems arise, claim the peace workers, because we have

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>assert, cannot be artificially constructed and then imposed but

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>These concepts, while they may reveal an element of political
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>naiveté which translates as liberalism, are not rhetorical. The
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>practical orientation of the movement to date, with its emphasis
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>on open and careful discussion and a decentralized approach to
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>developing democratic forms, is indicative of this fact.
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>From this perspective we might examine Bernadette Devlin&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>claim that the peace movement is “dangerous&quot; because it “dulls

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of respect for the individual and of a genuine “creative form of

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the &quot;violence” the movement condemns is but a manifestation of
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>something far more profoundly significant. The peace people are,
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>in my opinion, not reacting simply to a specific incident of vio
				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>lence, nor even to violence in the abstract. They are (perhaps

				<lb facs='#facs_85_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>not being challenged so much as how justice is socially defined.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>was pretty unhappy. Everyone was a chronic alcoholic like my-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>self and the discipline wasn’t very great. Most of the people came
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and went out of the local hospital.

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Most of the women cannot find or hold jobs. Often they are
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>placed in welfare hotels where their checks are lost or stolen or
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>they are unsuccessful in budgeting their money. These city
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>financed hotels are poorly kept places of despair and misery.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Pimps, addicts and junkies hang out in the lobbies and the women
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>fear being robbed and assaulted. Worst of all is the loneliness.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>There are few programs to reach the many people isolated inside
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>their rooms. Without treatment or any kind of community or
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>family support, problems of mental illness intensify.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I felt that I had already accepted Jesus as the truth and the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>only salvation, so I was drawn to visit a church fellowship house
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>that was nearby. This was a nationally organized Christian fel
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>lowship house where people lived together in very tight com
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>munal situations where they could receive the word of God.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Pretty soon I decided to move in. It was a good move. They knew
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that living together in a tight situation often makes somebody
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>grow very fast, and I did that for a while. I grew very fast, but
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>after two weeks l had to go into the hospital again.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>When I came out, I decided to go back to this same house
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and things went pretty well until two weeks later when I started
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>another drinking binge by drinking all of the vanilla in the house.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>When I did that, I ran out and ran down the street and I thought,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>&quot;Well, l’ve replaced vanilla bottles on a Sunday morning before.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>This is no sweat. This is real easy.&quot; And that was it. I couldn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>stand one more moment of hunting down vanilla bottles. I guess
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>it was the love l had for other people. So I prayed, &quot;God, l’m too
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tired to drink anymore. You just gotta do something about it,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and I turned around and I ran home and told my pastor about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>From that day forward I didn’t take a drink in that house.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>After a while I decided to leave that house because I had
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>obviously been cured and no longer needed the fellowship of
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Christian people. I thought I could do well enough on my own
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and I wanted my own life. I came to New York to visit friends
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>and I stayed with my sister and her family.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Ithink I was pretty unhappy at the time. Pretty lost at sea.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>think a lot of people come to New York to be alone with them-
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>selves or something; to cut off ties with people they know. It&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>kind of a self-destructive thing to do, to come to New York
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>without any concrete plans and I might have been doing that,
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>My sister is pretty happily married and sometimes weve
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>been very close, but I was not finding a way to live with the con
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>tentions going on around me. I wasn’t able to cope with people
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>who had never met Jesus. My sister was one of those people, and
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>it became very hard for me to cope. You see l’m basically (
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>back-sliding Christian. For about a year now l’ve felt God&apos;s kind
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>of deserted me, but His word is still pretty faithful, and in my
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>sister&apos;s house I wasn’t finding a way to live, so essentially I guess!
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ran away. I just upped and left one day.

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>While it is estimated that there are as many as 3,000 home

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>I stayed in the park and I wandered around for a while.1
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>don’t remember how I found the Shelter. Maybe through the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>grapevine. Iwasn’t thinking too clearly then. Im hoping to get on
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_8_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>welfare, or maybe I could get a job as a salesgirl somewhere. For
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_8_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>tunately or unfortunately I don’t drink anymore. It doesn’t seem
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>to be a problem. There are too many other things to occupy my
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>mind. Occasionally when I get desperate, I head for a bar or
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>something, but usually Istop in midstream and change my mind.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The goal of the Shelter is to provide a short-term residence

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>or placed in an appropriate institution, but the recidivism rate
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>runs to 50 percent. The women do not get the kind of help they

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>You see the thing was like my mother. She had a problem

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>split up the family they just made the kids wards of the court.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>There were nine of us and I was right in the middle.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>My younger brothers and sisters went to the orphan home,

				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>never seen the judge. They just decided to send me up. They
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>didn’t say why. They didn’t say much of anything. They just saia
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>something about going for a long nice ride and enjoying the
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>scenery. You know they don’t tell you nothing. They took me up
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>there and when we got there they told me where it was after they
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>locked me up.
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>After I got there, the doctors that talked to me got maddel
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>than hell for them to bring me there because I was only fourteen
				<lb facs='#facs_88_r_11_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and the patients that were there were mostly either forty or fifty.

				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and he said he liked to
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ave the person that sent me there for
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>one hour and call him dirty names. Most of the patients there
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>were old people. I was the only young one. That makes a big dif
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>ference being a young person and then being with so many old
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>people.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I stayed in the hospital that first time three or four months
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>until they asked me a lot of questions and they figured I was
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>okay. Then they sent me back to a nursing home in Quincy. See,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>in Illinois when people get out of state hospitals sometimes they
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>send them to nursing homes with full privileges and all.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>But my mother started coming round and asking for my
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>money and stuff. She told me to come over and see her, so I went
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and brought her a sack of groceries. She didn’t like me staying at
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the home, and I just figured, well, l’Il stay at my mother&apos;s. So I
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>stayed at my mother’s house and all of a sudden a policeman
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>came down saying he was going to take me to jail because I was
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>still a ward of the court, see. And I wasn’t supposed to be at my
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>mother’s. Course I didn’t know cause the law don’t tell kids
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>anything anyway.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>So they took me to jail and they had a new judge. Came in.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>He said, &quot;You ain’t guilty of nothing, there’s no charges against
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>you,&quot; and he said, &quot;I got some real nice people where you can live
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>with them, real nice, that&apos;Il treat you right, treat you decent and
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>everything. So he introduced me to the Parsons, see, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Parsons decided to get me a job. He was a guy that worked for
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the state and he went around helping teenagers get jobs. He just
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>loved teenagers, working day and night to help them. He got me
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>a job at the Pepsi-Cola plant working on an assembly line sorting
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>bottles. Istayed there about four months and then the boss said l
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>wasn’t able to keep up, you know, work fast enough. So he said
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>that being he liked me he&apos;d keep me a month longer because he
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>hated to, you know, see me go.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_l' n='N034'/>The only alternative to the streets available for many people
				<lb facs='#facs_89_l_2031' n='N035'/>is an institution.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Later on when I was older they let me go to St. Louis to live
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>with my mother in the boarding house she ran. I lived there for a
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>while but my mother had a drinking problem. I couldn’t under
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>stand her too well. So one night I decided to go to Kansas.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>When they picked me up they found out that I once was at the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>state hospital by questioning, so they kept me in the hospital in
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Kansas for three months and then they transferred me back to the
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>hospital in Illinois.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>At the hospital they sent me out to a workshop where 1
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>folded bags and put them in a little packet. I got S18 a month but l
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>didn’t keep my money. I did good deeds. See, I lived on a ward
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>where nobody had soda or cigarettes, nothing. I’d go out and
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>bring back somebody a jar of coffee and we’d have coffee and
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>play cards. I don’t like no kind of institution but I figure if l&apos;m
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>going to live there l’m going to do good to the patients.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>One time I decided to go to San Francisco. I cashed in my
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Social Security check and got a bus. It was a nice trip. I went to
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>look at the ocean, sat on the beach for a while and had me a
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>cheese sandwich with several different kinds of cheese and French
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>bread. That was real nice, but when I was in the bus station I left
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>my purse on the bench and went over to look out the window.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>When I came back it was gone, so I didn’t have another cent left
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>to me. After a while a policeman came over to me, real nice, and
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>he says, &quot;Anything I can do for ya?&quot; I says, &quot;No, I don’t want to
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>tell you my problems. I don’t want to cause you no trouble, but
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>back home everybody talks about California. How great Califor
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>nia is.&quot; He said, &quot;You&apos;d better believe California&apos;s great.&quot; He said,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>&quot;We help people, the people help us. He said, &quot;Now is there
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>anything I can do for you?&quot; and I told him that I lost my purse
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>and he said, “Well, l’Il just send you over to this Catholic place.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>They’ll keep you till your check comes, or else they&apos;ll send you to
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>another place till you can get back on your feet.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>So I went over to the Catholic place and they kept me for a
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>while, but then they sent me back to Illinois, to the home.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>It’s horrible in the home. When they put you in an institution
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>they practically destroy your life completely. When you’re young
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>and you have to be around people that are old. You figure you
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>can be classified, say, with them. It gets to you. Here I am. Ain&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>done nothing. Ain’t been nowhere. Course l’ve done a few things,
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>but if I have to spend all my life in institutions, well, I won&apos;t be
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N018'/>putting nothing into life. I won’t be getting nothing out of life.
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N019'/>One of the patients in the home used to talk about San Fran
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N020'/>cisco, so l’d been to San Francisco, and there was another patient
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N021'/>who talked a lot about New York, so I thought, well, l’Il go to
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N022'/>New York. l’d always heard about a store called Macy’s. I heard
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N023'/>it was a block long and I thought l’d like to see that!
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N024'/>The buses had a 550 special. Usually it costs about S100 to go
				<lb facs='#facs_89_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N025'/>to New York, but they had a special where you can go anywhere

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>When I got to New York I went up to an officer and told him

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>sit all night long. It was a small room with people sleeping on
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>chairs. The next morning they sent me to welfare, but welfare
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>refused to help me because I was on SSI. Eventually I found the

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>At first I lived with my mother. She was having a great many

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>so when I was in the sixth grade she sent me to Bay Shore to live
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>with her sister. That was a nice home life for me and I stayed
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>there for two years. I don’t really know what my mother’s prob-
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>lems were. She couldn’t straighten out her life, her bills, her

				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>When I came back she had gotten rid of her boyfriend, but
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>something had happened to me. I didn’t want to go to school be
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>cause I was getting pimples. I became silent and quiet and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>wouldn’t take a bath or anything. My mother didn’t understand
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>then. It got to the point where I practically couldn’t do anything
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>and my mother didn’t make me. When I went to school I kept
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>dropping.to the bottom. I had no interest. I was a very confused
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>person.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>My mother later signed me out to go to work.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>I lived at the Simmons House for a few years and during that
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>time I had several office jobs, but I was never really happy.I
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>started becoming depressed and having a lot of problems. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>at that time that I met the man l&apos;ve been living with for the past
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>three years. He used to hang around the Simmons House looking
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>for girls. When I met him, I had just left my last boyfriend and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>was very lonely. He insisted I move in with him right away.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>didn’t want to but I gave in. I was very weak then. I had no mind
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>of my own and would allow myself to be led any way withou
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>really knowing what I wanted.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Things were okay for a while, but then I got pregnant and
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>that messed everything up. I had to give up my job and I began
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>staying home. My boyfriend really wanted to have me like
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>maid in the house and to have other women outside. Sometimes
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>he would stay away the whole weekend and not say anything
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>about where he had been. At night I never knew if he would be
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>coming home or not. When I asked him what he did, he said i
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>was none of my business. Getting women seemed to be all he
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>thought about. I once heard him telling his friends that his biggest
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>dream is to get an answering service and to come home and tum
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>on his answering service and then go out with whoever he wants.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Ifelt like I was going crazy because I had no outlet. My only
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>girlfriend is in the building, and then I found out that my boy
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>friend was trying to turn everyone against me. He was telling her
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that I never did anything, even the laundry, and that I was lazy
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>and good for nothing. When I found that out, I was so hurt about
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>the way he spoke about me, about the way he was getting a car
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and locking me in that I didn’t know what to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Everything got to be too much. That’s when I tore up the
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>furniture. One morning I took a knife and tore it all to pieces.
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>couldn’t take it anymore. I tried to get out, but there was no
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>choice. Ihad stood it for as long as I could and then that morning
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>I ripped everything to shreds. My mind was very calm. I dont
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>even remember where my little boy was at that moment. Some
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>times I wonder what he saw. I know he knew something was up
				<lb facs='#facs_90_r_9_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>because later I saw him looking at the couch, just staring, like ne

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to family court. It was difficult. Iwas very mixed up and I didn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>know what to do. I did a lot of things wrong. I took out a

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>to give them up. I placed them to get self-sufficient.
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The first time I got to visit my boy after he was placed in

				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>suddenly couldn’t even hear what the people around me were
				<lb facs='#facs_91_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>saying and I was looking at him. Then I had to go into the bath

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I’m standing on my own two feet.... 1
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>remember when I was little, l&apos;d want to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>stay home from school—I hated the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>yeshiva, I hated it for eight years, in the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>fourth grade I said, thank you God, thank
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>you God, only four more years of this
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>I used to want to stay home but you
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>wouldn’t let me. Daddy would let me stay
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>home... but he would never want to tell
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>you. He would tell me, &quot;A lie of omission
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>is not the same as a lie of commission.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>You used to come home from teaching
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>school at three o’clock in the afternoon,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>but the yeshiva didn’t let out until 4:30.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>You used to come in and go out again be
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>cause you were very busy —you were a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>very busy woman —you had a lot to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>So—Daddy had a very simple solution.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>At five to three I would hide in the closet
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>in my bedroom. He would hide me in the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>closet. I would hide there until almost
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>four o’clock. I would hide in the closet so
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>you wouldn’t know I wasn’t in school.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The closet had a closet inside it —I know
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>this is very peculiar now, but I didn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>know it then. In the front part of the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>closet were a lot of clothes, and my fath
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>er’s graduation picture, his graduation
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>from law school: St. Lawrence Univer
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>sity, Brooklyn Law School, 1932. That
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>meant he went to law school at night. I
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>used to look at his picture in the closet
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>his diploma too — and wonder why it was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>there. In the front part of the closet with
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>his picture were a lot of clothes. And in
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>the back, past the first clothes rack, was a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>smaller closet, a creep-in closet. And in
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>between the two, on a kind of sill, were a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>lot of shoes, old shoes. Your old shoes.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>You used to wear really serviceable,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>cheap shoes when you taught. Every day
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>you wore sensible, cheap, serviceable and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>sturdy shoes but in the closet there were
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>wonderful shoes —silver dancing shoes
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>with high heels and buckles, silver danc
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ing shoes from the 1920s or 30s, laced
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>with thin silver laces. I used to wonder
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>what they’d be like on your feet —you
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>had such sturdy legs, sturdy, serviceable
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>sensible legs.... l’d hide in the closet, and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>l’d look at your shoes, and l’d sit down
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>among them and wait for you to walk out
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>the door.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>You always thought that dressing up
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>was very important. l’m sure you believe
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>that clothes make the man—and the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>woman—but 1 always felt that shoes
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>made the woman. You’d always dress me
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>up for photos, in costumes that other
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>people gave you. 1 always wore everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>else’s hand-me-downs, it was such a sensi
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ble thing to do. You&apos;d dress me up for
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>photos, I remember. I remember one —1
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>still have it, or you do —1 was wearing a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>scotch plaid dress, a little blonde jewish
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>girl with a dutch haircut in a scotch plaid
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>dress —you made me hold it out in a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>semicircle as though I were squaredancing
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>- and on my head was a little scotch cap.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>I was smiling, Ihad a tooth missing. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>wearing plain brown shoes, laced oxfords.
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>You were not very interested in the shoes!
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>wore for these photos. You always in
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>sisted I had to get sensible ones, so my feet
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>would grow right, and I always wore
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Stride Rite shoes. But once you took me,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>when I was five or six, to get a pair of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>mary-janes that had—a buckle. Two
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>buckles —that’s it, they had two straps
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and two buckles. And the two straps lay
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>across my feet like two hard fingers grip
			</p>
			<pb n='93'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ping them, in such a way that the bone be
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tween them was pressed upward. They
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>pressed on this bone in the most peculiar
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>way and l’d say, &quot;mommy, mommy,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>mommy —these’re, these’re pressing on
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>my feet, they’re pressing on my feet and
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>my feet are getting to be shaped funny.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>You said, &quot;No, these shoes are good.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>They’re expensive shoes. These are good
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>shoes. These shoes are good for you.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>And so 1 have, on each foot, a bone that
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>protrudes on the top, because of these
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>shoes that pressed my feet into a funny
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>shape.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>I remember once, the teacher called you
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>from school and said, “Her boots don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>fit. And you said, “But they’re new
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>boots.&quot; But those boots —those boots
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>were someone else’s boots, they were
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>hand-me-down boots. I think they were
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>hand-me-down boots, or maybe they
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>were new boots. They were size 8. You
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>always bought me things very large, so l
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>would grow into them. Now you want me
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>to dress my child in enormous clothing, so
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>he’Il grow into it. These boots were size 8.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>I wore size 4. “Never mind,&quot; you said,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>&quot;you’ll grow into them.&quot; I wear size 6
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>today. But you were sure l’d grow into
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>those size 8 red rain boots. The teacher
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>called to say, &quot;She can’t walk in her
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>boots, they keep doubling up under her
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>feet every time she takes a step; maybe
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>she’s got the wrong boots. You&apos;d better
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>come get her, it’s raining out and she
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>needs her boots.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>There were times that I recall being at
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>your feet, on my hands and knees. From
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the time I was about 10, you and I used to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>be alone all week in the country house
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>together, in your sister’s country house,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>while Dad worked in the city. l’d always
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>want to stay up at night and read. I read a
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>lot, I loved to read. It was my one chance
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>for privacy. All day I was away, swim-
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ming. l’d swim in the lake from early
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>morning till lunch, hop out, climb up the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>bank, eat some lunch, and hop back in.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Creeping, as it were, past you, doing the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>crawl. But l’d have to come out at dinner
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>time and endure all through dinner. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>evening I just wanted to read. But you al
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ways wanted to go to bed early. There
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>were four bedrooms in the house, but you
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>always insisted that we sleep in the same
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>one, so as not to get the others dirty. You
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>always reminded me that it wasn’t our
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>house. So, at about 9:30 or 10 we’d have
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>to get into bed, you into yours and I into
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>mine, and turn out the light and go to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>sleep. But l’d never be tired. So l’d lie
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>there, and count your breaths: Listen,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>and listen, and listen and... l’d sli-i-ide
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>down the side of my bed, cre-e-ep on my
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>hands and knees —holding the book, try
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>ing to get out the door and into the bath
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>room, where I would read by the night
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>light you always left burning. MOST of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the time, though, you&apos;d give a start and:
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>what’s that, what&apos;s that?&quot; You’d get up.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>see me, grab me, and knock me around.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>You used to threaten to get your shoe, but
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>you always made do with your fist, some
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>times you’d choke me a bit. When I got a
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>little older I wasn’t so interested in read
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ing; l’d set my hair every night with
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>bobby pins and little rollers, the way my
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>girlfriend Rosemarie taught me. On warm
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>evenings we’d pretend to take a walk
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>together but really we’d stand by the side
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>of the road, in the driveway, with our
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>chests puffed out and our bellies sucked
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>in, in short shorts and little clingy jerseys,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>barefoot or in sandals. We’d strike bath
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ing-beauty poses and stand stock-still,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>waiting for the boys in their low-slung
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>souped-up cars to drive by and whistle
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>and leer and make the sound of kisses.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Iremember once seeing your shoe, as it
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>came up to hit me in the ear. I was about
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>17, and I thought you were out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>house. I was on the telephone to my girl
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>friend. She was somebody I liked a lot but
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>I was kind of afraid of her because she
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>went to the High School of Music and Art
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>where l’d wanted to go but you wouldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>let me because it was too far away —and
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>you were probably right — it was too far
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>away — to travel from Brooklyn almost to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the Bronx —or so it seemed, that it was
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>too far —anyway, I was on the phone,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>and I thought you had stepped out, and I
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>was lying on the floor in my room, talk
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ing on my phone. It was my phone be
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>cause once my brother called up to speak
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>to me and Daddy answered the phone and
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>he didn’t know who it was, and he said,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>&quot;Who is this?&quot; and Larry, realizing that he
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>didn’t know it was his own son, said,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Martha home?&quot; And Dad said, &quot;WHO IS
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>THIS?? WHY DO YOU WANT TO
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>SPEAK TO HER? WHADDOYOU,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>WHADDOYOU WANT WITH HER?
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>...And so Larry got me a phone; he was
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>upset by that kind of behavior. He
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>thought it was an invasion of privacy.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>thought it was normal. Anyway...so
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>there I was, on my phone, on my floor,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>smoking a cigarette. See, that was the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>kicker —I was smoking a cigarette. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>forbidden to smoke. I can understand, l&apos;m
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>a mother too, that you were protecting
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>my health. Anyway, you came in and you
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>saw me lying on the floor and you kicked
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>me in the head. l’m sure you were aiming
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>at the cigarette, but you got me right in
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>the ear. Luckily, I wasn’t deafened. How-
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>never
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>spoke to that...friend
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>ever,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>again.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>I used to really believe that shoes made
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>the woman. I would buy a new pair of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>high-heeled shoes, you know the kind
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that people —that women — wore when 1
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>was growing up, do you remember those?
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>Very high, very high pointy spike heels
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>with pointy toes? And l’d buy ’em and l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>think, “Tonight’s the night...a date...
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>romance...dance... and l’d go out.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>And they’d be fine. They&apos;d be fine for a
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>while and then l’d realize they were press
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>ing on a nerve; they always pressed on a
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>nerve. They were fine in the shoe store,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and I always thought, “These are better,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>these are different, these really feel fine,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>and l’d make it about, oh, a quarter of the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>way through the evening and l’d have to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>take my shoes off. Now, if there’s one
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>thing that a woman wasn’t supposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>be, it was flat-footed on her own two
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>feet; I mean, flats were for lower-class
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>girls; nobody wore flats. And nobody
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>walked around without their shoes, not if
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>you wanted to keep your reputation. So
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>there I was, spending the evening at a
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>dance without my shoes and having to go
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>home, through the streets of New York
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>City, freezing cold in tattered stockings
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and l&apos;d say...&quot;I made that mistake
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>again
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Cinderella was oppressed; she was
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>treated badly. She was given only crusts
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>and scraps to eat and old cast-offs to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>wear. Often she had to go without shoes.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>She had to perform endless household
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>chores. The chill and the lack of food
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>made her light-headed. She was very un
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>happy and could only escape through
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>daydreams. Nobody thought of training
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>her to be a lady.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Her stepsisters were given all the ad
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>vantages; their every move was scruti
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>nized and corrected, their diets were
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>watched. They had the fanciest clothes,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the most fashionable little slippers and
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>boots. Their mother planned to make

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Betty Bonnet was her name. She was the one with all the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>hats. One had a grey plume that stuck out the top. Mother said i
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>was ostrich. Betty was only a little girl, maybe twelve or thirteen
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>But she had the most beautiful clothes — coats with fur collars
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>brown velvet dresses with white lace around the neck for parties.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>She had such pink cheeks. Her hair fell in long curls from under
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the hat. I wanted to be her. I wanted to take her out of her com
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>partment and play with her. Take the dresses and choose for
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>myself. Fold the paper tabs over her shoulders. She would go to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>school, she would be the prettiest. She would be me. I would
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>make her lovely for everyone. Like Mother said I was to be when
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>I had to sit still so she could brush my hair, parting each side for
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>braids. She pulled tight; pulled and twisted each braid with her
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>strong hands.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Mother said no. Not until you are older and know how to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>touch them. They are fragile. Paper. Betty was her favorite. All
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>those years living between the yellowing pages of the magazine
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>that smelled like the closet in Grandmother’s house. Each doll had
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>a place, with all her dresses, her hats. One had a fur piece with
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>just enough space for the head to fit through. It was Betty’s older
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sister. Mother had a fox stole too. Sometimes she wore it to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>parties. She is my mother. They are her dolls.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>One day I was allowed to play with Betty, just Betty. Mother
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>went to the heavy chest in the dining room. She took out the box
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tied with strings. She was a child too. She hid things. She hid
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>things from me. She didn’t want me to know. Betty was her
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>favorite, my favorite. She had the best clothes. When I touched
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>her the paper felt like silk. I chose the blue dress with buttons
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>down the front and legs attached. Her high shoes matched. She
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>matched perfectly. I asked Mother if that’s the way she dressed
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>when she was twelve. Be careful, she said.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>She tightens the braid until it hurts. Now look for yourself in
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the mirror, look. She slips my head between the slit in the hat, she
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>tells me to smile. In the mirror I am beautiful. In the mirror I am
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>paper; I am flat, flattened. I am to be placed somewhere and she
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>is cutting.

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>I set up at Artists’ Space, the Leo Castelli Gallery, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Whitney Downtown, where a video camera on a tripod behind
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>me instantaneously transmitted the image of the letters, words,

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>I have been very happy and absorbed. I had two perfect little
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>bodies come out of my body. My body was huge and soft and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>full of milk. I held and nursed and fondled and fed and dressed
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>and undressed and talked to and listened to my babies in an
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>unending orgy of interdependence. Since Mira and Bran were
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>born I have had no time to myself except sleep. But now I have
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>been hired by Carl Andre to do this job of sitting for three hours
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>a day in an old green space with a sign eight feet from my right
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>eye about possibilities for art production.... So Carl is
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>unwittingly my first patron (this work), my inspiration and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>my competition. My materials were paper and pen, now I have
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>a typewriter here so that what 1 am doing now is part typing what
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>I have already written and part writing now and it all has to do
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>with the future. My economic resources are not vast, but neither
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>are my needs. I figure I need 5500 a month to support myself and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>half of two children which works out to 58.20 an hour if I work
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>three hours a day five days a week which is all I want to spare
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>right now from my children. The economic resource I have right
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>now from this job is really time. The rest is all my subjective

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>write whatever I am thinking publicly so that it can be simul
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>taneously read. I am not being particularly clear, but this is the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>boring part where 1 am trying to elicit interest and support and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>collaboration or patronage or whatever. Already I feel a need to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>rewrite the beginning. This work is writing about this work.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Writing about this work is this work. I am keeping my private
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>journal publicly. I am the Delphic oracle. I am studying to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>shopping-bag lady. I am redefining art. I want to be in a public
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>room with a typewriter and some machinery, maybe video, that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>could shoot a written page of 8½ by 11” paper and project the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>image of it on a wall or screen, but so it is easily legible. The room
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>is somewhat dark except for a good light on my typewriter. I am
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>writing down whatever I am thinking as fast and completely and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>well as I can. People come in and watch and read. There is a
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>xerox machine somewhere so that xeroxes of pages may be made.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>I want to find out what and how I think. I want the publicness of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>it to interact with the process of finding out. I like using machines
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>although I am not technically proficient and comfortable with
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>them because they and art are the two metaphors for the mind

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>terrified. If I thought it were joy I might be still and meditative
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>and happy, but that is different from this absorbed state of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>working that I am in. This is where there is that possibility of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>inarticulableness, either stoned or orgasming or making or con
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>templating art or mystical experiences. There is the temptation
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>of feigning speechlessness because of fearing the inadequacy of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>words. It can’t be the words that are at fault, but my laziness.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>Outside there is a New York sirocco blowing hot restless moving

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N001'/>l’m wearing only a light short cotton dress and a pair of under
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N002'/>pants. A pair of underpants is only one thing unlike a pair of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N003'/>mittens. I feel naked and lustful and agitated. I just thought about
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N004'/>Gertrude Stein and Jill Johnston as heroines, but I didn’t like to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N005'/>think it because it broke my other train of thought. l’d rather
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N006'/>stay physical today. While digging in my purse for cigarettes
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N007'/>(a man wouldn’t have written that) I found a three-inch high
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N008'/>light gray plastic horse, missing its flowing tail but complete
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N009'/>with flowing darker mane and red indented nostrils and lips, that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N010'/>belongs to my children. Well, I bought it for them but it&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N011'/>questionable if children actually own things at all.... I remembei
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N012'/>Lambie, a big soft stuffed white lamb I slept with, and later used
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N013'/>to dust with my mother’s perfumed talcum powder to make him
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N014'/>white again. Funny that I thought he was male. I wonder when 1
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N015'/>started dividing the world that way and what arbitrary rules did
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N016'/>I make up in unknown gender cases like toy animals and why.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N017'/>I did write a list of the first hundred words the babies spoke, but
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N018'/>I haven’t written them a journal of their daily activities. That&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N019'/>their bedtime story every night anyway so I suppose I could tape
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N020'/>it and save it for them for eternity. “Once upon a time there
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N021'/>was a little boy named Bran and a little girl named Mira and this
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N022'/>morning they woke up very early and woke up their mommy and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N023'/>daddy and had eggs for breakfast and....&quot; Every once in a while
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N024'/>I get conscious of switching the order girl/boy, boy/girl, every
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N025'/>alternate night, but often slide back to Bran/Mira several nights
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N026'/>in a row. I even started telling it “Once upon a time there were
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N027'/>two children, one named Mira and one named Bran... so that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N028'/>there wouldn’t even be the boy/girl differentiation at all, but l’m
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N029'/>afraid that they and I are already conditioned that way. Bran is
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N030'/>masculine and Mira is feminine and they get more and more
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N031'/>different every day. I hope that Mira won’t hate me when she
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N032'/>grows up. I hope that all the femininity that I have inevitably
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N033'/>inculcated in her will be perceived as positive and valuable
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N034'/>instead of the degrading powerlessness I have often been made to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N035'/>feel. The only way 1 can attempt to assure that is to make sure
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N036'/>she grows up with good images of female power surrounding
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N037'/>her, starting with my own self. And that means not totally
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N038'/>answering her current demands of all my time and affection and
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N039'/>attention so that I can go out and get myself powerful and make
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N040'/>sure that I feel it and feel good about it. Which is difficult to do.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N041'/>Which l’m not pretending to do for her sake, but knowing that it
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N042'/>is also for her makes me stronger. It’s for Bran too but not as
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N043'/>empathetically. For a long time 1 was taught to see my mother,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N044'/>and she was being convinced to see herself, as a mean, castrating,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N045'/>frigid, evil bitch. I don’t blame her for that, but I would blame
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N046'/>myself if I let Mira suffer the same thing. She will have to suffer
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N047'/>something else. Some new pattern. In my mother’s family one
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N048'/>only talks about the women, at least as far back as the civil war,
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N049'/>because they were the interesting ones and/or they lived longer.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N050'/>Anyway it is the female line that is traced. I read a diary of my
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N051'/>mother’s mother’s mother’s mother who was a southern belle
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N052'/>named Emma Munnerlin, daughter of a rice plantation and slave
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N053'/>owner, who married Charles Stocking, a yankee whose family
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N054'/>had been long settled in the Connecticut River valley. He made
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N055'/>a small fortune and then the civil war broke out and his brothers
			</p>
			<pb n='96'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>and cousins were all fighting for the union. He got wiped out
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>financially and went catatonic for a while and then just psychoti
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>cally morbid and depressed and afunctional. Emma’s brothers
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and father were killed and ruined so she had to move north with
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>two infant daughters and a crazy husband and support every
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>body by giving french and music lessons to the local yankee
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>daughters. She didn’t complain in her diaries and they are not
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>too exciting to read unless you already know the story and
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>empathize a lot. She had been brought up with a personal slave
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>companion, a girl a little older than herself, who brushed her
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>long hair for her every morning and every night. They must have
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>started out like twins or best friends or lovers and been trained
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>to accept their difference in status. Her slave would have been
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the real child of the black woman who suckled her and the reason
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>the woman was still full of milk for the little white baby. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>easier to imagine the rage that the black baby girl woman might
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>have felt but probably didn’t than to understand what subtle
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>unconscious mixtures of interdependence and guilt and affection
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and tyranny Emma might have felt. Either way there’s no record
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>of it. Only imaginings based on experience or literature or
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>movies. One of my best friends throughout high school was a
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>very brilliant, angry, tricky and unfathomable black girl, one of
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>the three or four blacks in the whole hypocritical elitist
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>bourgeois school. 1 am a complex and conscious racist. I wish I
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>weren’t a racist at all, but l am a racist and a sexist and would
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>probably be a capitalist imperialist if I had the chance. Fighting
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>those things personally can either give or take away the strength
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>to fight them on a political level....
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>When Eva Hesse died, some friends of mine were moving
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>into her place on the Bowery, and they knew how poor I was,
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and they said I could have any of the materials I could salvage
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>from the heaps on the floor. I took inks and charcoals and water
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>color sets and oilpaints and cords and tubing and strings and bits
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>of rubber and everything. I figured it might be magic and I needed
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>all the money I was making (working for a real estate agent in
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Brooklyn) for food anyway. I can never have too many bottles
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of half-evaporated foul-smelling multicolored Higgins ink and
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>little wads of used art gum erasers. I carry it all with me from
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>studio to studio. First to the 5th floor of 323 Greenwich St, then
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>to Mulberry St, then to the country, then to the 4th floor of
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>323 Greenwich St, then to 319 Greenwich St. It comes in handy.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Except for the horrid little nose masks for working with plastic.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>One time I used a whole lot of that material plus other stuff
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>to make work in the woods. I was reading a lot about shamanism
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>at the time and, while thinking, I would spend all day in the
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>woods, one late summer into fall, making things from painted
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>strings and painted wood and the trees that were there and the
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>rocks and a brook and rubber slingshots and the works were visi
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>ble enough to be photographed but invisible enough to be magical
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>traps. Nobody ever saw them except the man I lived with and
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>the man who used to own the woods and still walked his dogs
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>there and perhaps an occasional hunter. I always wore red when
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>I worked so I wouldn’t be shot at. And big rubber boots so the
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>copperheads and rattlesnakes wouldn’t bite me. One weekend
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>some people were coming to visit. A critic and a painter. I was
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>very excited because 1 wanted them to come see my work. 1
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>worked hard on Friday afternoon in the woods (after cleaning
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>the house and shopping and making beds etc.). They arrived for
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>supper and it was dark. I woke early Saturday morning from
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>excitement and anxiety and went walking to the woods to see
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>everything once more alone before it became public and found
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>everything I had done wantonly destroyed and stolen and
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>dragged away and gone. This art is writing about this art.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>Writing about this art is this art. I love grammar but I don&apos;t
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>understand its relation to meaning. If thoughts are born in words,
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>as words, then the grammar is part of their initial existence. If
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>thoughts are born not words, then the words come next and then
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the grammar is invented for them that puts them in the best
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>order. My daughter has just invented or discovered a sentence
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that she says all the time which is the question “What is the
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>-being any noun she knows, mommy,
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>-doing?
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>truck, daddy, brother, cookie, kitty, chair, table, toy, etc. 1
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>answer the question as best 1 can when it refers to anything
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>capable of action (doing) but I get confused by &quot;what is the cookie
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>doing?&quot; Sometimes I just say &quot;it is&quot; or &quot;it is being a cookie” or
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>’the cookie is sitting on the chair where Mira left it, waiting for
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Mira to hurry up and eat it before Poppy or Bran does&quot; or &quot;I
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>don’t know, Mira, what is the cookie doing?” to which she replies
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>&quot;UH.&quot; She has three answers to the kind of questions that I don&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>know the answers to myself, No, Yes, and uh. It is not grammar,
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>anyway, which is only a structure, but the enormous number
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of words and then the mathematical infinity of combining any
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>two, three, seven, twenty-four, thirty-three of them in one
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sentence that staggers the imagination....
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>l’ve been thinking about Suzanne Harris’ work Locus Up.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>It is experientially describable as a saint approaching death. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>made of sand and stucco walls. Suzanne looks to me like a
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>combination of Joan of Arc and Saint Sebastian by various
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>renaissance masters. I think she is very beautiful. That may not
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>be relevant but I wrote it anyway. The saint approaches her
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>death. She walks slowly in the sandy desert and the horizon
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>melts away as the sand rises symmetrically on either side of her
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>progress. She won’t look back which is the only way to see the
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>world and people and life she is leaving behind. She looks straight
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ahead at a narrow dark doorway cut into the mound of sand
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>ahead. Inside is a cool, dark but short passageway that
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>immediately and clearly opens into a bright round limited space.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>In the center of the bright round space, so huge that it takes up
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>three-fourths of the space is an implacable white cube. The saint
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>looks up into the blue sky above. She has left everything else
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>behind and entered into her own metaphor for her soul, hermetic
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>and infinite. She is not afraid.
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>I wrote a very long list of all the women who I think are
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>beautiful that I have been in the same room with. This is all
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>related. I have been trained by art at the service of society to see
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>certain things as beautiful: sunsets, flowers, stars, jewels, fruit,
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>oceans, shells, trees, mountains, circles, colors, sunrises, and
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>rocks and mothers with children and gold and sunlight and eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_96_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>and animals and glass and wood and shiny things; calligraphy

				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and we all decorated each other with rose petals. But I worry
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>about Chang Ching. What if both she and Mao had been mythol
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ogized together, as an inseparable passionate toward each other
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>and passionate to the revolution pair. He would seem less a
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>father if he were also seen as a lover. Wasn’t it Justinian and
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Theodora who ran such an ideal government and she had been a
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>dancing girl or something. I know I used to think that all men
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>were republicans and all women democrats. (My daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>sometimes declares that all girls have blue eyes and all boys have
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>brown eyes, but now she has a blue-eyed doll with a penis so her
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>faith is a bit shaken.) (She also knows her brown-eyed halfsister
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>has a cunt which is the word used opposite penis in this house
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>because vagina is just not one of my favorite words and cunt is
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>despite its frequent misuse as an insult.) I was taught that men
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>were republicans because they had to worry about money and
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>they didn’t like to give it to poor people and that women, because
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>they didn’t have to work and are naturally extravagant and
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>generous and soft-hearted, are democrats and fuzzy-headed
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>liberals. Also because women can afford to be idealistic and

				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>three choices. December 2nd. You see, yesterday was short and
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>unsatisfactory. There was a chinese piano tuner and a dinner
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>party, the place I live in was not described, a tiny baby and very
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>cold weather. My eyes are heavy-lidded, always have been. I
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>don’t look innocent. I have of course been told that my eyes are
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>beautiful, but they aren’t. They are hooded and abandoned and
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>of a blue more organic than mineral. They feel tired except when
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>I remember they are round balls mostly inside my head. They
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>are not just what they appear. Once 1 saw a short accompanying

				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>physiology and physics of the eye. I especially remember the
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>waves of color, the red short and angry jumping and the blue
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>long and peaceful wavy like the ocean. Then they made gray
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>rosebushes turn all red. Would that it were that simple. I hate
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>mysteries. I would truly like to know everything. l’d like to begin
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>with all the most important things and then all the subsidiary
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>facts would just fall into place in an orderly way and wouldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>be worrisome instead of just accumulating a lot of small things
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>and reasoning out their places to build a structure I cannot
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>imagine the shape of until I have finished building. I would like
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>some blinding flashes like Einstein had on the trolley. I would
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>like not to have to work so hard and be so heavy-lidded. I would

				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>I might find enough details for my constructions. No, I scream at
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>myself, that is not where it is found these days, politely hiding on
				<lb facs='#facs_97_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>a quiet page, you might find it in the bathtub with your body or

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>well documented. Analysis has shown the

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>I began to research the ways in which

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>female conversations between intimates in
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>their homes.
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Initially, I hoped to tape record argu

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>discovered that such overt power strug

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>talk reveals a division of labor between
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>men and women in conversation which
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>supports our more general positions ol

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>speaking is an attempt at producing con
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>versation. The question of whether the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>attempt is successful or not depends on

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>stop it right there
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>How, then, is the work of interaction
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>accomplished in conversations between
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>male and female intimates? Who does
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>what kind of work? To find out, I listened
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>to 52 hours of tape-recorded conversation
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>between three couples who had agreed to

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>their apartments. The apartments were
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>small enough for the recorder to pick up
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>all conversation from the kitchen and
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>living room as well as louder talk from the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>bedroom and bath. The tape recorder was
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>in place from four to 14 days. The tapes
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>could run for four hours without interrup

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>couples insisted on doing the switching

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>from one to four hours. The talk did not

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The Preliminaries
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>I made some interesting discoveries
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>even before I began my analysis, through
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>casual conversations with the people in
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>volved in the taping. First, in all three
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>cases, the men set up the tape recorders
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>and nearly always turned them on and
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>off, sometimes without letting the women
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>know. The reverse never occurred. Now,
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>controlling a conversation is more than
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>controlling the topic; it is controlling the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>situation in general—not only what wil
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>be talked about, but whether there will be
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>conversation, and under what terms it
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>will occur. The tape recorder introduced a
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>new element into the routine home situa
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tion. Controlling the tape recorder meant
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>controlling part of the situation in which
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>conversation took place.
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Second, there was the issue of normally
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>private interactions being available to a
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>third party, the researcher. In addition to
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>the men doing most of the censoring of
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the tapes, they made other attempts to
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>control what I heard. For instance, the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>clicks that are recorded when the machine
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>is turned off (and my own sense of the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>conversations) helped me to separate time
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>segments. One man carefully erased all
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>clicks on his and his partner&apos;s tapes, con
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>fusing my attempts to identify different
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>time segments.
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The second case was worse. I had made
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the mistake of asking one couple to heli
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>me transcribe a particularly difficult tape
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of theirs—a conversation about a book
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>club selection. In fact, they couldn’t hear
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>themselves any better than I could, and
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the man wanted to know why 1 was
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>interested in the conversation. He kept

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>tion, kept saying that only the gist of the
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>conversation (which he could tell me) was
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>important, and repeatedly tried to tell me

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>These preliminaries already suggested
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>that men are more likely than women to
				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>control conversation. The men made sure

				<lb facs='#facs_101_r_8_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>they attempted to control my interpreta

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>in their talk, but because the men did not
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>respond, did not do any interactional
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>work. The men’s remarks succeeded be
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cause of interactional work done by the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>women in response to them.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>When I analyzed specific transcripts, it
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>appeared that the men did very little to
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>gain such control, and by doing very
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>little, they displayed power without spe-
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>cifically exercising it. A turn-by-turn
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>analysis revealed the women&apos;s constant
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>conversational work. They struggled to
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>get responses to their own remarks or
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>were busy responding to the men’s re
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>marks. In my analysis, I identified a num
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ber of strategies used in conversational
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>work. These strategies reveal the differ
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ential work men and women do.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Asking Questions
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Questions are a powerful kind of utter
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ance. They are half of a paired relation,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>with answers the second half. That is,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Q-A is a unit, not two separate things.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Questions demand answers, while state
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ments do not demand other statements. If
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>no answer is given, its absence is notice
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>able and can be complained about. A
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>question in conversation works by begin
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ning a two-part sequence; it ensures an
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>interaction of at least one utterance by
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>each of two participants.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Counting the questions in about seven
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>hours of tape, I found that the women
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>asked two and a half times more questions
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>than the men did—150 to 59. At times, it
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>seemed that all the women did was ask
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>questions. Then I began noticing my own
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>speech and discovered the same pattern. 1
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>often made questions out of remarks that
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>could have been statements: &quot;Isn&apos;t it a
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>lovely day?&quot;, &quot;Shouldn’t we go grocery
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>shopping?&quot; I then tried to break myself of
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the &quot;habit&quot; and found it was difficult.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Many remarks came out as questions be
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>fore I noticed. When I did succeed in
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>making a statement, I usually did not ge
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>a response. It became clear that I wasn&apos;
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>asking so many questions out of habit,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>but because unless I did, my attempts at
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>interaction would fail.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>Attention-Getting Devices
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>Attention-getting devices are remarks
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>that, whether they give information or
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>not, attempt to get the attention necessary
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>to begin conversation. The women used
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>these devices consistently while the men
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>did not, indicating the women’s difficulty
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>in assuming that what they said would be
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>treated seriously and would generate a
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>response. l&apos;ve identified three types of
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>attention-getting devices.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The first was originally discussed by
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Harvey Sacks when he explored children&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>restricted rights to speak in the presence
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>of adults.” Sacks noticed one type of
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>question used extensively by children as a
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>conversational opening:
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>D’ya know
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>what?&quot; This type of question is answered
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>by another question: &quot;What?&quot; The first
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>speaker is then in the position of having
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>obtained the attention needed to say what
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>he or she wanted to say in the first place.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>This is a Q-Q-A sequence, setting off a
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>three-part exchange. Sacks further point
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ed out that while the use of this device
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ensures children&apos;s rights to speak, at the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>same time it acknowledges their restricted
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>rights. These three-part sequences in con
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>versations tell us about the work of guar
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>anteeing conversation as well as identify
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>ing differential rights of the participants.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>In the five hours of my transcripts, the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>women used this device twice as often as
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the men.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Second, there were many instances of
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>y know&quot; in the transcripts. This phrase is
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>an attempt to see if the other person is
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>paying attention. It was used 34 times by
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_5_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the women and three times by the men.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The use of the phrase increased as the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>men’s responses decreased.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Third, &quot;This is interesting,&quot; or a varia
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>tion, was used throughout the tapes. By
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>engaging in conversation people indicate
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>that there is a mutual interest in what is
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>being said. When one uses “This is inter
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>esting&quot; as an introduction, it signals that
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the remark itself may not be seen as
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>worthy of attention. The speaker is work-
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>ing to establish the interest of the remark.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>In the five hours of transcribed material,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>the women used this device ten times, the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>men seven.3 When interest is not in ques
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>tion, that work is done by both inter
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>actants. The first person makes a remark,
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the second person responds to it, and
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>together they establish its joint interest.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Minimal Response
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>A minimal response refers to a speaker
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>saying &quot;yeah,&quot; “umm,&quot; &quot;huh,&quot; and little
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>more. Both men and women used this
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>but often in different ways. The men used
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>the monosyllabic response as one step
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>short of not responding at all. For exam
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>ple, the woman made a long remark, and
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>the man responded with &quot;yeah,&quot; which
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>neither encouraged her to continue nor
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>elaborated the topic. Minimal responses

			<pb n='103'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>used in this way display lack of interest
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>and attempt to discourage further inter
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>action.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>The women also used this kind of min
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>imal response at times, but mostly in a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>way that is best termed &quot;support work.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>While the man talks, the woman skillfully
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>inserts &quot;mmm, &quot;yeah, oh,&quot; throughout
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>the stream of talk. By doing this, the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>woman signals that she is paying atten
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>tion to what is being said, that she is fully
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>participating, that she has a continuing
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>interest in both interaction and interact
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ant. This is done with agility during the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>speaker’s pauses, seldom causing even
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>slight overlaps. Nothing in either tone or
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>structure suggests that the woman is try
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ing to take over the talk.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Making Statements
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Finally, there are statements that do no
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>specific conversational work. Of course,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>by its mere existence, a statement pro
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>vides for a response, and thereby does
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>some minimal work. However, it also
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>shows the speaker’s assumption that any
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>attempt will be successful and interesting,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>that he or she will be responded to. It is as
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>if the speaker assumes there are no prob
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>lems, that success is naturally his or hers.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>In the transcribed material, the men made
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>this kind of statement more than twice as
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>many times as the women. The substance
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of their remarks was not more interesting
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>than the women’s, but took on that char
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>acter because they generated interaction.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>An Example
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>One segment of conversation from my
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>transcripts is the beginning of an interac
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>tion. The woman is reading a book in her
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>academic specialty and the man is making
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>a salad. I originally transcribed it for
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>analysis because conversation seemed dif
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ficult for the woman, and she used stra
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>tegies to ensure some response. (1 suggest
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>reading the transcript before continuing
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>with the text.)
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>The woman (F) starts off in Set 1 with

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>right assumption, since M’s response in
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>Set 3 is minimal and both fall silent. Fs

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>There are subtle demands on women to

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>men, it often starts an argument.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Women who do not behave interac-
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tionally are punished; often it is implied

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>that define gender. We must constantly
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>behave as male or female in order for our

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Since interactional work is tied up with
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>female identity, with what a woman is,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the fact that it is work is obscured. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>not seen as something we do, but as part
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>of what we are, similar to caring for the

				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>seen as part and parcel of what women
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>are. In both cases, the value and necessity
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>of the work are hidden behind the screen
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_5_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>of the sexual division of labor.

				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>2. Famous Players and Odeon control over 80% of

				<lb facs='#facs_106_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N008'/>who favored “vertical integration“ — bringing all aspects of film

				<lb facs='#facs_115_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>The 1970s have brought a new kind of skyscraper which
				<lb facs='#facs_115_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>simply swallows up the city. Instead of a tower being presented as
				<lb facs='#facs_115_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the typical building in the center city, it becomes a substitute for
				<lb facs='#facs_115_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the city. More and more resources and activities are concentrated

				<lb facs='#facs_115_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>best it can. In New York, Rockefeller Center anticipated this

				<lb facs='#facs_115_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>restaurants, the complex is in many ways a private urban realm

				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>This project is about the process of women giving birth to a new
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>architecture. It emerged in 1973 as part of my search for a femi
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>nist consciousness and process of woman-identification. I had
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>come to realize my own male-identification and conditioning —
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>especially as an architect (registered, licensed, numbered, legiti
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>matized by the patriarchy). What would a truly supportive
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>environment be if women had their way? Would women design
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>the world differently than men? I purposely began workshops
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>with women not professionally involved with architecture to
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>avoid the machismo conditioning the professional is subjected to.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>To some extent all women are conditioned by the dominant cul
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>ture, but they usually do not see themselves as creators of the
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>built environment. However, all women experience it, react to it,
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>live and work in it, and are affected by it, consciously or not. I
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>wanted to help lay a foundation for a new architecture based on
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>the experience, consciousness and creative imagination of women
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N017'/>in the process of self-definition. — NPB

				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N001'/>In 1968 I began teaching architecture, including design &quot;method
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N002'/>ology,&quot; the process by which subjective experience and intuition
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N003'/>are systematically objectified and rationalized. I was unaware oj
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N004'/>how one-dimensional this approach is and how it isolates mind
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N005'/>from body, feeling from action, and divides people into male
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N006'/>female, white/non-white, rich/poor, old/young. While objective
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N007'/>description is important, it is incomplete. As I became involved in
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N008'/>the women’s movement, I recognized the importance of listening
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N009'/>to myself, of trusting my own experience. By 1974 I had taught
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N010'/>hundreds of students, less than one percent of them women, and
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N011'/>was still the only woman faculty member in the University of
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N012'/>Detroit School of Architecture. Despite my strong connection to
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N013'/>other feminists, I felt painfully fragmented and isolated. I urgent
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N014'/>ly needed to explore many conflicts between my woman-identity,
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N015'/>my teaching and the man-made environment, to discover and
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N016'/>embrace the environmental sensibilities of other women. —LKW

				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>We began collaborating in 1974, collecting women&apos;s drawings of their environmental fantasies in workshops conducted across the
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>country, literally &quot;from Maine to California.&quot; The women constituted a wide cultural cross-section — diverse in life style, age, experience
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and education.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>A workshop participant notes, &quot;Underlying the fantasies is a common kind of understanding. I know the sources from which thes
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>needs arise. I feel them too.... I can relate to the messages in these drawings because l’ve experienced so many of the same frustrations,
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>needs and daydreams. They seem to reflect me in them too. It makes me feel really connected to other women.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Readily apparent is the intense hunger for a truly supportive environment. Although many drawings reveal humor, whimsy,
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>imagination and complexities, there are frequently signs of neglected and unfulfilled needs. There are expressions of anger and rage, often
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>convoluted into a light-hearted joke, a defense mechanism familiar to many women. The range of vision is characterized by women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>multiple rhythms and experiences. There is no one dominant statement. Nevertheless, we have noticed patterns that speak of shared
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>experiences and common aspirations.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>AUTONOMY, CHOICE AND CONTROL. We see networks of accessibility, intricate support systems, a desire for greater mobility
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>in limitless landscapes, a tremendous openness usually qualified by a definite need for protection, through either distance or symbolic,
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>metaphysical barriers. Many women depict retreats, but most often with some connection to the public domain.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>FLEXIBILITY, ADAPTABILITY AND CHANGE. The drawings relate the shifting of human mood to the shifting of environmental
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>form over time. Architecture is not static and monolithic, but manipulable, expanding and contracting, organically evolving —stretcha
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ble nets, systems of attachment and separation, multiple purposes, recycleable forms.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>LIFE AS A MOSAIC OF CONTINUOUS EXPERIENCE. Many drawings show a spatial organization that is multicentered, fluid,
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>informal and non-linear. Time is perceived as a continuum, often embodied in swirling movement and spiraling forms.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>INCLUSION OF THE HUMAN DIMENSION. The expression of physical and emotional intimacy is consistent. Although there are
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>vast spaces and vertical forms, there is little abstraction or monumentality. Spaces are described directly in terms of human activity
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>relaxing, dancing, working, screaming, lovemaking, eating.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>INTEGRATION OF BODY/SENSUALITY AND MIND/ORDER. Sensory stimulation plays an important role — temperature and
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>climate, surface textures, sounds, smells, the softening of hard-edged shapes into more fluid architectural forms. At the same time, work,
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>technology, order, thought and access to information are included within these spaces. Water, plants, colored prisms, soft pillows and
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>saunas coexist with libraries, toolshops, financial institutions and computers.
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>RECOGNITION OF LIFE’S COMPLEXITY AND AMBIGUITY. Forms are often open-ended and inclusive — tapestries of complica
				<lb facs='#facs_118_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tion and detail, wheels within wheels of wavelike organization, inclusiveness within a private space that shows an awareness of multiple

				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in which self-actualization can be achieved. A truly supportive
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>environment would consist of cooperative, non-competitive,
				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>dynamic, in/out interactions with each other, a lack of power

				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>new women’s culture. We are reclaiming language, poetry

				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>can learn much from our past, but there is an urgent need to listen

				<lb facs='#facs_119_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Architecture is rarely created in isolation. It must be evaluated

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>humor&quot; is used to connote humor created by women and dealing
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>in some way with woman’s role in the human condition. Of the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>various theories, the psycho-sociological approach, stressing the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>notion of humor as social interchange, may be most fruitful for
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>our purposes. Humor is potentially part of every social structure
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>and affects all social systems. When the subject is relationships
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>between women and men, men are traditionally permitted to
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>tease or make fun of women, who in turn are required to take no
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>offense; in fact, we are frequently expected to join in the &quot;fun,
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>even though it is at our own expense. This context is similar to
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>that of racist humor—gratifying one group at the expense of the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>underdog; its purpose is to throw blame on some group and to
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>reinforce its inferior position. In this process the role of the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>scapegoat itself is vital. Generally, as O. E. Klapp points out, the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>scapegoat has a specific socially defined role and position. To the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>dominant group, &quot;the fool represents values which are rejected by
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the group, causes that are lost, incompetence, failure, and fi
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>asco.&quot;“ The fool’s position is degraded, but simultaneously val

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>that there is an underlying, continuous, collective process that
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>ascribes this fool’s role to a group of people as a means of

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>answer is that for the most part, there weren’t any. Yes, there
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>were stories told by Dorothy Parker, Ruth Draper, and maybe
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>one or two others, but generally there has been no women’s
				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ingroup humor until very recently.
