			<head><title>Feminist Abstract Art—A Political Viewpoint </title></head>
			<byline><persName>Harmony Hammond</persName>
			</byline>
			<p>There are many articles written on feminist art which try to pinpoint and define a
				feminist sensibility. Few of these articles go beyond the recognition that feminist
				art is based on the personal experiences of women by beginning to question its
				larger political implications and the role it plays in feminist revolution. Most
				articles originating from the art world tend to be formal descriptive attempts at
				documenting what women are doing, and do not attempt a feminist analysis of function
				and meaning.</p>
			<p>In a reactionary escape from formalist criticism, most movement writing on feminist
				art deals with political issues, but lacks any real understanding of the creative
				process, how it functions for the artist and how it affects form and content.
				Without such an understanding it is impossible to evaluate the work as art. While
				feminist poets and writers comment on each other's work and write of their own
				processes, we visual artists tend to remain silent and let others do the writing for
				us. Our silence contributes to a lack of dialogue between artist and audience, to
				the lack of criticism from a feminist perspective, and ultimately to the misinter-
				pretation of our work.</p>
			<p>In this article I wish to focus on abstract art and show that it can have a feminist
				basis and therefore be political. Feminists are not only people to attempt political
				or revolutionary art, but because certain ideas and issues occur over and over, they
				are of interest to us and worth exploring. I will focus on one area of abstract art
				by discussing concepts of marking and language in feminist drawing and painting-to
				show its origin, meaning, and political potential.</p>
			<p>In "Prime Time: Art and Politics"<note type="scholarNote"><persName key="Freeman, Alexa" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/284775217/">Alexa Freeman</persName> and Jackie MacMillan, "Prime
					Time: Art and Politics," <title>Quest: A Feminist Quarterly</title> (Summer,

					1975).</note> <persName key="Freeman, Alexa" ref="http://viaf.org/viaf/284775217/">Alexa Freeman</persName> and <persName>Jackie MacMillan</persName> look at how art is viewed in

				this capitalist, patriarchal society and criticize activists for reacting too
				quickly and overlooking the revolutionary potential of art. However, they in turn
				react to male estabishment myths about abstract (non-representational) art and
				exclude it from feminist and political potential. They view abstract art as private
				expression which is not understandable or analyzable to the audience, and therefore
				irrelevant to feminist political goals. Thus they incorrectly see elitism as a
				pre-condition of abstract art, rather than realizing that this is how abstract art
				has been used by men as a defense mechanism against the alienation of their own
				capitalist system; that as well as furthering the myth of artist as alienated and
				isolated genius, abstract art has offered an illusion of objectivity. Such notions
				suggest that the content of one's work can be separated from one's political
				beliefs. By sponsoring international exhibitions showing apolitical abstract

				paintings by former Communist Party members, the C.I.A. (via the <orgName key="Museum of Modern Art" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q188740">Museum of Modern

				Art</orgName>) has sought to impress other nations with the cultural freedom of the U.S.A. The
				way in which Abstract Expressionist art was defined and developed by the artists and
				then used by others to further cold war politics in the fifties is only one example
				of the manipulation of abstract art to create the illusory separation of art and

					politics.<note type="scholarNote">Eva Cockcroft, "Abstract Expressionism, Weapon of the Cold War,"
						<title><title key="Artforum" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q386599">Artforum</title></title> (June, 1974).</note> Thus when women continue to

				respond to abstract art as "apolitical," they are reinforcing and maintaining myths
				established by men.</p>
			<p>The Freeman/MacMillan article is typical in its analysis of art and politics.
				Abstract art has become taboo for most artists who consider themselves political
				feminists. Because of the history outlined above, it is difficult to determine
				abstract painting's relationship to feminist ideology. There are radical feminists
				who are making abstract art. Radical feminism operates from the belief that women as
				a class are oppressed, and that a mass political women's movement is necessary to
				overthrow male supremacy.<note type="scholarNote">Brooke, "The Retreat to Cultural Feminism," in
						<title>Feminist Revolution</title>, ed. Redstockings (New York,
					1975).</note> Therefore, we might ask, how are the visions of radical feminists
				analyzed and portrayed in this art?</p>
			<p>It is necessary to break down the myths and fears surrounding abstract art and make
				it understandable. Women—artists and non-artists—need to talk about art, and talking
				about abstract art need not be more difficult than discussing portraits, nudes,
				vaginas, or whatever. Every work of art is understandable on many different levels.
				It is by talking about our work and work processes that we will not only begin to
				develop a new language for interpreting abstract art, but also to integrate this
				work with society. This language, which I see evolving from consciousness-raising
				techniques, will be able to be shared with any woman, regardless of class
				background. For artists, such a dialogue with the audience is essential, as it
				offers valuable feedback for the development of our art.</p>
			<p>I want to reclaim abstract art for women and transforrn it on our own terms. It is
				interesting to note that much of women's past creativity, as <pb n="67"/> well as
				the art by women of non-western cultures, has been abstract. I'm thinking of the
				incredible baskets, pottery, quilts, afghans, lace and needlework women have
				created. Many of the motifs used were based on "the stitch" itself. The repetition
				and continuity of the stitch or weaver formed the individual shape and also the
				pattern resulting from its repetition. Usually these motifs and patterns were
				abstract and geometric. Patricia Mainardi points out that they had specific meaning
				for the women who made them, and in a sense formed a visual language in
				themselves:</p>
			<quote>in designing their quilts, women not only made beautiful and functional objects,
				but expressed their own convictions on a wide variety of subjects in a language for
				the most part comprehensible only to other women. In a sense, this was a secret
				language among women, for as the story goes, there was more than one man of Tory
				political persuasion who slept unknowingly under his wife's 'Whig Rose' quilt. Women
				named quilts for their religious beliefs...or their politics-at a time when women
				were not allowed to vote. The 'Radical Rose' design, which women made during the
				CIvil War, had a black center for each rose and was an expression of sympathy with
				the slaves.<note type="scholarNote">Patricia Mainardi, "Quilts: The Great American Art," <title>The
						Feminist Art Journal</title> (Winter, 1973).</note></quote>
			<p>As we examine some contemporary abstract art by women, it is important to develop a
				sense of identity and connection with our own past creativity rather than that of
				the oppressor who has claimed "fine art" and "abstract art" for himself. In fact,
				the patriarchal putdown of "decorative" traditional art and "craft" has outright
				racist, classist, and sexist overtones. Elizabeth Weatherford states:</p>
			<quote>Art history assigns creative products to two categories -fine arts and crafts-and
				then certifies as legitimate only the fine arts, thereby excluding those creative
				traditions of primitive people, peasants, women, and many other groups outside the
				mainstream of Western history.<note type="scholarNote">Elizabeth Weatherford, "Craft for Art's Sake,"
						<title>Ms. Magazine</title> (May, 1973).</note></quote>
			<p>Until recently, decorative art, or craft techniques and materials, have been valid
				only as sources for contemporary male artists. While women working with these ideas,
				techniques, and materials have been ignored (Ann Wilson first painted on quilts in
				1958) or put down for doing "womens work," men like Shields, Oldenburg, Stella, and
				Noland are hailed as innovative. But times have changed. Today many female artists
				are connecting to a long line of creativity by proudly referring to women's
				traditional arts in their own work. They are recording the ritual of women's
				artmaking both in the past and the present, thereby reflecting a feminist concern
				not only with the end product but with the dally process and function of making art.
				Sewing techniques and materals as both process and content are used in a variety of
				ways in the abstract works of Sarah Draney, Pat Lasch, Nina Yankowitz, Paula Tavins,
				Patsy Norvell, Rosemary Mayer, and many other women. Barbara Kruger says that she
				first learned to crochet and sew when she decided that these techniques could be
				used to make art.<note>Ibid.</note> For women, the meaning of sewing and knotting is
				"connecting" —connecting the parts of one's life, and connecting to other
				women-creating a sense of community and wholeness. Other women, drawing on women's
				traditional arts, make specific painterly reference to decoration and craft. Miriam
				Schapiro utilizes remnants of fabric, lace, and ribbon along with handkerchiefs and
				aprons in large collages, thus making the very material of women's lives the subject
				of her art. Joyce Kozloff and Mary Gregoriadis explore decoration as fine art,
				basing their paintings on the abstract patterning of Islamic architecture and tiles,
				Tantric art, Caucasian rugs, and Navaho weaving.</p>
			<p>The way many women talk about their work is revealing, in that it often denies formal
				art rhetoric. Women tend to talk first about their personal associations with the
				piece, and then about how these are implemented through visual means; in other
				words, how successful the piece is in its own terms. This approach to art and to
				discussing art has developed from the consciousness-raising experience. It deals
				primarily with the work itself, what it says and how it says it-rather than with an
				imposed set of esthetic beliefs.</p>
			<p>In her excellent catalogue introduction to "Changes," an exhibition by Betsy Damon
				and Carole Fisher, Kathryn C. Johnson comments that "intent" is most important when
				defining feminist art. She states that it is "a powerful oneness of subject and
				content" that makes certain work feminist:</p>
			<quote>...Their work both is and tells about the pain of their life experiences. It is
				about pain and is painful, but does not present woman as passive victim. The pain is
				presented with deep understanding of its sources and effects, and the anger which
				follows confrontation with the hurt.<note type="scholarNote">Kathryn C. Johnson, catalogue introduction
					to "Changes," exhibition by Betsy Damon and Carole Fisher at the College of St.
					Catherine (St. Paul, Minn., 1976).</note></quote>
			<p>Fisher writes:</p>
			<quote>Betsy looked at the work and recognized the fact that I worked to survive, to
				keep from growing crazy, and to keep the pain from becoming too great. She
				recognized the pain in my work instantly! This was something I had only come to
				recently recognize and acknowledge in my work. Like many women in our culture, I had
				become adept at hiding and covering my pain. I had gotten all the messages that to
				be vulnerable in our culture is to be weak and despised.<note type="scholarNote">Ibid</note>.</quote>
			<pb n="68"/>
			<p>It is this "oneness of subject and content" that carries their work through feminist
				consciousness beyond the personal to the political. It is also present in abstract
				paintings that seem superficially more related to the male modernist tradition than
				to women's creativity in that they involve the physically expressive manipulation of
				paint on a two-dimensional surface.</p>
			<p>In much of this work the reoccurring stitch of women's traditional artmaking becomes
				the repetitive mark, taking on a new form as a "visual diary." Such works are dally
				records of thoughts and are used as such by the artists. Just as the weaver
				continues from day to day, from one physical and psychic location to another, mate-
				rials and dyes changing slighty, irregularities and tension showing, the painted
				marks also reveal daily emotional changes and tensions. They are a record of present
				feeling, a ritual giving in to the repetitive gesture, a language to reveal self-a
				woman's mantra.</p>
			<p>Jenny Snider's nervous lines recall ancient Chinese calligraphy, which has both a
				letter/ character reference and a body/figure reference. Her drawings are made with
				and are about her nervousness and vulnerability. She "is" the mark, the line. As the
				marks are repeated and contained in different spaces (usually grids or rectangles
				suggesting fabric, rooms and houses), the quality and feeling of the line changes
				and she becomes more comfortable in some spaces than in others. She explores her
				self-image and feelings about her body in relationship to other people and spaces.
				Snider describes these works as "figurative." To me, it is the mark and its
				repetition that is most important. Her works are figurative in the sense that
				Chinese calligraphy is figurative-in having a direct body reference. Works are
				sometimes combined or used interchangeably with the markings, reinforcing Snider's
				commitment to the diaristic mode. As she says, "The words and lines come from the
				same psychological place and gesture and are not intended to describe or explain
				what the drawings are in terms of images-but rather express the fact that they come
				from a nervous hand and a yakking heart." Phrases such as "little sounds arose (and
				it showed)"; "Well, for one thing, never step on broken glass"; and "Remember when
				we saw the ocean? It was just like this, wasn't it?" tell where the drawing is
				coming from and what the drawing is about.</p>
			<p>Louise Fishman's paintings also function as a place for personal confrontation and as
				a statement directed towards other women. Earlier, Fishman ripped up her old
				paintings and reconnected them by sewing and knotting them together with fragile
				thread. Her past was used to make a statement about her present. The strips and
				connecting thread formed loose grids, transformed in later work to a series of
				strokes or marks repeated across the page of canvas or within the confines of a
				"particular felt shape" (a circle or a piece of irregularly cut masonite). The marks
				of paint, layered on top of each other, lead eventually to a rich sensuous sur-
				face. The top layer usually consists of strong marks holding the partially revealed
				undermarks to the painting surface-feelings revealed and hidden. Fishman has always
				talked about her work in terms of hiding, guilt, vulnerability, anger, and personal
				individuation.</p>
			<p>In a seven-panel reversible painting on unstretched canvas, Fishman deals with her
				feelings about her mother, also an artist. One side of each canvas is painted with
				calm strokes, while on the other side the marks explode into intensely scrawled
				letters reading "A letter to my mother about painting." Another canvas has the star
				of David and the words "I am a Jewish working-class dyke" scratched into the
				surface. Just as consciousness raising leads to political awareness; this work moves
				from the personal into the political. Titled Angry Jill, Angry Djuna, Angry Paula,
				Angry Sarah, and so on... they seem to be painted with the anger. When she made
				these "angry paintings" Fishman said that all she could feel was her rage. When she
				looked around at other women, she saw that they were crippled by their anger too.
				These paintings were made to force women to confront it rather than letting it turn
				inward and become self-destructive. Grouped together as a wall of women's anger, the
				paintings show a tremendous amount of energy that can now be redirected towards
				feminist creativity and revolution.</p>
			<p>These women as well as others (Joan Snyder, Carla Tardi, and Pat Steir, to name a
				few) have used words and marks fairly interchangeably as abstract gestures with
				concrete feminist meanings. Words are marks and marks are words; their repetition
				becomes not only an interior monologue but also a dialogue with other women. Like
				Damon and Fisher, these artists make individual feeling and experience the subject
				of their work, while the content deals with the difficulties and ambiguities of
				being a feminist artist in a patriarchal society.</p>
			<p>Their painting surfaces are often violated on mutilated; cut, gouged, ripped,
				scratched, or torn. The reversal of the usual additive process of painting refers to
				the violation of the traditional painting surface and also to the physical and
				psychic violation of women. The thick paint applied with a palette knife in
				Fishman's work, for instance, acts both as poultice for wounds and cement for
				holding self together. In Joan Snyder's recent work the marks, cuts and burning
				combine with words and color to make a passionate statement about sexuality.</p>
			<p>This work is certainly political. Yet Freeman and MacMillan, in their attempt to
				distinguish protest from political art, to show that specific forms are more
				conducive to one or another, <pb n="70"/>still ignore the political potential of
					abstraction.<note type="scholarNote">Freeman and MacMillan, op. cit.</note> They accept male
				definitions of what art is, and do not deal with the evolution of a feminist
				creative process or feminist art forms. Theirs is a reformist approach to a
				revolutionary endeavor.</p>
			<p>I am reminded of Andrea Dworkin's "afterword" "The Great Punctuation Typography
				Struggle" —in her book Woman Hating, where she explains how the text was altered
				against her will by the publisher's insistence on uppercase letters and standard
				punctuation. She had wanted the book to be as empty of convention as possible, to
				create a new form that would merge with the content.</p>
			<quote>reading a text which violates standard form forces one to change mental sets in
				order to read. there is no distance. the new form, which is in some ways unfamiliar,
				forces one to read differently-not to read about different things, but to read in
				different ways. <lb/> to permit writers to use forms which violate convention just
				might permit writers to develop forms which would teach people to think differently:
				not to think about different things, but to think in different ways. that work is
				not permitted.<note type="scholarNote">Andrea Dworkin, Woman Hating (New York, 1974).</note></quote>
			<p>The fact that innovative form is so feared by the male establishment shows that like
				content it has a power of its own. If our lives and our art are connected, and if
				"the personal is political" in the radical sense, then we cannot separate the
				content of our work from the form it takes. </p>
			<p>As abstract artists, we need to develop new abstract forms for revolutionary art. The
				women's work I've discussed here, and I include my own, is moving in this direction.
				We are not yet there. Hopefully, as we create art within the context of other
				women's art, and within the context of evolving feminist theory, we will develop a
				new visual language. Art in transition is political, for it both is our develop-
				ment and describes our development. In a sense we are coming out through our art,
				and the work itself is a record of the ongoing process of developing a feminist
				esthetic ideology. </p>
