				<head>Patience</head>

				<lg>
					<l>There is no need now to rush about my life,</l>
					<l>I have time, each day, to unfold</l>
					<l>carefully, my rage —</l>
					<l>no longer impotent,</l>
					<l>But the most powerful force in the universe.</l>
					<l>(Do you hear me, Mother?)</l>
					<l>Slowly like a sunflower like a tree,</l>
					<l>Revolution unfolds before me:</l>
					<l>Newspaper pages beginning with world news,</l>
					<l>and ending with the comics,</l>
					<l>and classified ads announcing the end</l>
					<l>of things as we know them.</l>
					<l>Inevitably the world, the nation, the city,</l>
					<l>the arts, society, sports</l>
					<l>and personals</l>
					<l>will be recycled</l>
					<l>By patient origamists, armed with love.</l>
				</lg>
			</div>

			<div type="poem" n="II">
				<head>Questionnaire</head>
				<lg>
					<l>There is unfeminine (but oh, so Female)</l>
					<l>sureness in my hands,</l>
					<l>checking "No." to every question</l>
					<l>in the Harris poll, Reader's Digest,</l>
					<l>Mademoiselle,</l>
					<l>I am an outlaw, so none of that applies to me:</l>
					<l>I do not vote in primaries, do not wish to increase</l>
					<l>my spending power, do not take birth control</l>
					<l>pills.</l>
					<l>I do not have a legal residence, cannot tell you</l>
					<l>my given name or how (sometimes very) old</l>
					<l>I really am.</l>
					<l>I do not travel abroad, see no humor in uniforms,</l>
					<l>and my lips are good enough for my lover</l>
					<l>as they are.</l>
					<l>Beyond that, no one heads my household, I would not</l>
					<l>save my marriage if l'had one, or anybody else's</l>
					<l>if I could.</l>
					<l>I do not believe that politicians need me, that Jesus</l>
					<l>loves me, or that short men are particularly sexy.</l>
					<l>Nor do l want a penis.</l>
					<l>What else do you have to offer?</l>
				</lg>

			<div type="poem" n="III">
				<head>I Argue My Case</head>
				<lg>
					<l>Gentlemen of the Jury:</l>
					<l>I have had the time and opportunity to appear</l>
					<l>before you in the guise</l>
					<l>(disguise) of every woman:</l>
					<l>to you, sir, l was the dumb hand</l>
					<l>that wiped your</l>
					<l>table,</l>
					<l>to you, sir, a flimsy black</l>
					<l>skirt on legs,</l>
					<l>to you, some hard</l>
					<l>down-on-me woman who might</l>
					<l>(or might not) yet</l>
					<l>be downed again.</l>
					<l>To him, an ass,</l>
					<l>to him, a breast, a leg</l>
					<l>to him.</l>
					<l>To that one, just another working bitch.</l>
					<l>To each, another history, to each</l>
					<l>another (partial) lie.</l>
					<l>We women are liars, you say.</l>
					<l>(It is written.)</l>
					<l>But you have made us so.</l>
					<l>We are too much caught up in cycles, you say.</l>
					<l>But your gods cannot prevent that.</l>
					<l>So we act out our cycles,</l>
					<l>one or many,</l>
					<l>in the rhythm of what has to be</l>
					<l>(because we say so)</l>
					<l>our common destiny.</l>
					<l>And so, before you are taken in by one of our</l>
					<l>perfect circles,</l>
					<l>remember also that we are in perfect</l>
					<l>motion.</l>
					<l>And when you (and you will)</l>
					<l>run counter to the flow of revolution,</l>
					<l>the wheel of women will continue to turn,</l>
					<l>and grind you</l>
					<l>so fine.</l>

			<p>Susan Saxe wrote this and other poems while she was living underground as a fugitive
				for 4½ years, during which time she was on the F.B.I.'s.Ten Most Wanted List for
				"overall radical activities." On March 27, 1975, she was arrested in Philadelphia
				and since then has been tried for allegedly taking part in a Boston bank robbery 7
				years ago in which a policeman was killed. Saxe became "a feminist, a lesbian, a
				woman-identified woman" while underground. She is now in prison awaiting
				sentence.</p>
