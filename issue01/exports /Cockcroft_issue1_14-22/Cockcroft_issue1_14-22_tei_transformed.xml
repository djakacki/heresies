			<head><title>Women in the Community Mural Movement</title>
				<lb/><persName>Eva Cockcroft</persName>
			</head>
			<p>Women's role in the community mural move¬ ment is much greater than is generally recog¬ nized. Major city-sponsored mural programs in Boston (Adele Seronde and Summerthing), New Vork
				(Susan Shapiro-Kiok and Cityarts), and Los Angeles (Judy Baca and Citywide) have been initiated and directed by women artists, who have given these programs much of their char¬ acter
				and philosophy. Women have led school mural projects, mural collectives, and mural¬ work with street youth. Whether working as individual muralists, members of coalitions, or in
				collectives, women have increasingly dom¬ inated the mural movement as a force for non¬ elitism, collectivity, and the practice of so¬ cial philosophies ranging from humanism to
				Marxism.</p>
			<p>Murals on urban walls reflecting the aspira¬ tions of neighborhood residents began as part of the more general social upheaval of the 1960s. Artists found themselves dragged into the
				social arena and forced to consider questions beyond those of pure form. By the late 1960s they could no longer avoid confronting questions concern¬ ing the relevance, audience, and
				uses of their art. A number of movements arose that tried to enlarge the audience and scope of contempo¬ rary art. Minority-group and politically active artists felt both a demand and
				an opportunity to create an art responsive to their special heritage and relevant to their own ethnic group, com¬ munity, or movement. Mainstream artists at¬ tempted to bring art out
				of the museums and into the cities in the form of urban super¬ graphics, environmental sculptures, street¬ works, and happenings. Out of the coincidence of these social and artistic
				forces the communi¬ ty mural movement began in 1967-68.</p>
			<p>The mural movement took on different forms in different locations, depending on which par¬ ticular combination of social forces spurred its beginnings. The first mural in Chicago, the
				1967 Wall of Respect, was painted by 21 Black artists from the Organization of Black American Cul¬ ture (ÖBAC) and celebrated Black history and culture. It was a political-art
				happening involv¬ ing musicians and poets who played and read as the painting progressed. Although women art¬ ists participated in the Wall of Respect, they were not among those who
				continued the movement in Chicago and went from the OBAC wall to paint in Detroit. </p>
			<p>For a long time Vanita Green's Black Women (1970) served as the token of women's participa¬ tion in the Chicago mural movement. Green was 17, a high school dropout, when she saw William
				Walker painting the Peace and Salva¬ tion Wall of Understanding near the Cabrini¬ Green projects where she lived. After watching for a time, she asked Walker for paints and brushes and
				on a storage shed nearby painted portraits of famous Black women from Aunt Jemima to Angela Davis. Almost immediately afterwards, the wall was defaced with large splashes of white
				paint, practically the only de¬ facement in Chicago up to that time. When Green saw what the vandals had done, she com¬ mented, "Before, it was just a pretty picture, but it says more
				now." In general, though, dur¬ ing those early years women found their place largely as assistants and apprentices in one of the two major community-based Chicago mural groups: Public
				Art Workshop, led by Mark Rogovin, and Chicago Mural Group, a multi¬ ethnic coalition led by William Walker and John Weber. </p>
			<p>In Boston, on the other hand, women played an important role in introducing the mural idea. Boston artist Adele Seronde’s proposal calling for the use of neglected city sites to
				transform the city into a museum was the start. Through the collaboration of Kathy Kane of the Mayor's Office of Cultural Affairs, the Institute of Con¬ temporary Art, a number of
				Black artists, and Seronde, Summerthing was launched. It was the largest and most productive of the early mural programs, beginning in 1968 and peaking in 1970. The Summerthing program
				combined ele¬ ments of three distinct phenomena which had emerged the preceding year—the renaissance in Black culture (Wall of Respect), the "Summer in the City Paint-in Festival" and
				various clean-up programs, and the desire of environmental art¬ ists to work in urban spaces. Summerthing sponsored Black Power murals, children's play¬ ground and pocket-park
				projects, and decora¬ tive walls—all within a framework allowing for neighborhood control. Under Seronde's direc¬ tion, the program emphasized the sociological rather than the
				decorative aspect of public art. Many impressive walls were painted from 1968 to 1970, especially in the Black communities of Roxbury and South End-including the first women's wall,
				Sharon Dunn's Black Women, painted in 1970. Seronde is only one of many women who <pb n="2"/> have made important contributions as organ¬ izers and administrators. Judy Baca, a
				leading Chicana muralist in Los Angeles, obtained City funding for a similar neighborhood-oriented large-scale mural program (Citywide Murals) in 1974. Shelly Killen heads a program
				for murals in prisons in Rhode Island, which has operated in the correctional institutions there for the past two years. Sandy Rubins Alternate Graffiti Workshop in Philadephia
				pioneered techniques for developing the artistic potential of graffiti writers; several of her workshop graduates have become muralists in their own right. Ruth Asawa and Nancy
				Thompson developed the Al- varado School-Community Program in San Francisco which brings community artists into the public schools to enrich the school experi¬ ence and has heped to
				open the doors to "Art- ists in the Schools" programs around the coun- try. In fact, at the present time, the majority of the mural programs throughout the nation are directed by
				women. </p>
			<p>The major influx of women artists into the mural movement did not take place until 1971- 73 when news about the community walls had become better known outside the actual mural
				communities. This was also a time of expansion for the Womens Liberation Movement. Many women artists tried mural work, but not all of them became muralists. Community mural work,
				although highly rewarding, requires a certain kind of openness and great dedication. It also demands physical labor, community or¬ ganizing, going to meetings, and an ability to deal
				with the great variety of people who come up to talk or make comments. However, a num- ber of the women who did become involved in the eanly 1970s now identify themselves as mur¬
				alists and are recognized for their artistic contri¬ butions. </p>
			<p>The development of Caryl Yasko one of the best muralists in the nation and a leader of the Chicago Mural Group, illustrates this process. like Green, Yasko was introduced to the mural
				movement through William Waker when she volunteered as a parent-assistant for a mural he was directing with children at her neighborhood school. After this experience, Yasko and her
				partner in a small art enterprise, Kathy judge, a ceramicist, worked with small children to paint Walls of Hope. Vasko and judge were then in- vited to join the Chicago Mural Group. In
				the summer of 1972, Yasko directed her first major project, Under City Stone, a mural that runs throughout the 55th Street underpass in Hyde Park. Painted from Yasko's design with the
				help of a team recruited from passers-by, it shows hundreds of figures walking around and, above them, the machinery, technology, and pollu- tion of today's city. Yasko painted herself
				in the <pb n="3"/>

				The following year Yasko painted in the heart of the Black-Belt South Side with a team of young Black people. Located on a prenatal clinic wall, this mural depicts statuesque,
				larger-than-life women with their children. In 974 Yasko broke new ground for the Chicago muralists. Although murals had become com¬ monplace in many areas of Chicago certain white
				working-class areas peopled by Polish and other Middle-European immigrants remained untouched. The question of whether murals were valid only for minority-group ghetto areas or would
				also be meaningful in white working¬ class neighborhoods was in the air. In those cities where the murals had begun with the Black Power thrust of the late sixties, a move¬ ment toward
				more general themes was begin¬ ning. In 1974 Yasko began a mammoth mural in the Logan Square area of Chicago. The mural uses symbolic figures and images to identify the values of the
				largely Polish and Bielorussian residents of the area and to depict them work¬ ing together to maintain control in a highly technical, mechanized world. This major wal has opened the
				door for a number of other murals in this and similar neighborhoods Yasko, however, is only one of many women muralists who have made important artistic contributions. Lucy Mahler's
				vivid mural at the Wright Brothers School in New York is one of the earliest murals on a public school building. Astrid Fuller with her distinctive combination <caption>Marie Burton,
					director. Celebration of Cultures. 1975. Mil¬ waukee, Wisconsin. (Photo: Weber.) </caption>
				<pb n="4"/> of a primitive literalism with surrealist images, has created a series of ambitious underpass murals in the Hyde Park area of Chicago. Holly Highfill, who painted an
				anti-war mural in the Loop area of Chicago (1973), has gone on to do several succeeding walls with gang youth. Marie Burton, who with Highfill and Rogovin co-authored the Mural Manual,
				works primarily with teenagers. Her Bored of Education in Chi¬ cago (1971) and the Celebration of Cultures in Milwaukee (1975) are among the most impres- sive of the school murals. And
				these are just a few of the women muralists working on com¬ munity walls in a way that might be called the Chicago model (others are Justine DeVan, Esther Charbit, Ruth Felton, and
				Celia Radek). </p>
			<p>In the Chicago model, the artist-leader of a mural team, using community and youth input, designs the wall and directs the painting of it. The community participates as a new class of
				patrons who help to pay for the mural and are consulted on the design. In spite of the change in patronage, and participation of community people as team members the Chicago model's
				emphasis on professionalism is fairly close to the mural tradition through the ages. Murals, after all, have rarely been painted by individu- als; mostly they are done by a group of
				assis- tants working under a master. </p>
			<p>This hierarchical process has been challenged by several developments within the mural movement. One is the experimentation with women muralists have come into the movement as or¬
				ganizers or members of a collective group. The mutual support and shared responsibility the collective offers an individual is often necessary to provide the courage to attempt a first
				mural (and some of the labor power to finish it). Es- pecially in the case of women this factor can be decisive. </p>
			<p>Within the Latin culture, machismo often reaches rather extreme forms yet this is coun¬ tered by a strong communal tradition. It is not surprising therefore that in 1974 a grounpof
				Latin American women muralists--Mujeres Muralis- tas--was formed in San Francisco. Most of the women were students of recent graduates of the San Francisco Art Institute and connected
				with the Galeria de La Raza, the center for Chicano artists in the Mission district. Their philosophy was simple and very positive: </p>
			<quote>Our cuftures, our images are strong. It is im¬ portant that the atmosphere of the world be plagued with color and Hife. Throughout His¬ tory there have been very few women who have
				figured in art. What you see is proof that women, too, can work at this level. That we can put together scaffolding and climb it. We offer you the colors that we make </quote>

			<p>Their two best-known walls, Latinoamerica and the Paco's Tacos Stand mural were both done in the spring and summer of 1974. They celebrate the beauty and richness of the Latin
				tradition. For Latinoamerica, the four women comprising the original core of Mujeres Mural- istas-Patricia Rodriguez, Consuelo Mendez Castillo, lrene Perez, and Graciela Carrillo de
				Lopez--worked together to create the design Different parts of the mural are painted by each artist in her individual style; yet the mural suc¬ ceeds as a unified work because of the
				clean organization, and the distinctively bright, clean color that is characteristic of the group. In the Paco's Tacos mural the unity is more tenuous. The wall divides into two
				distinctly different halves reflecting the different artistic styles of Consuelo Mendez Castillo and Graciela Carrillo de Lopez. In many ways Mujeres Muralistas was never feally a
				"collective," but rather a group of women who came together to work on a particular wall mural. An almost instant fame forced them into a prematurely formalized exis- tence as a
				"collective group," while leaving them little time to resolve differences in politi¬ cal consciousness between members of the group, or cultural differences between Chicana and Latin
				American women. The probem of individualism was never really tackled, al¬ though there was an attempt to make decisions by a consensus of the group. Internal differen¬ ces caused the
				group to dissolve formally early in 1976. The women who comprised Mujeres Muralistas are now working as individual muralists. </p>
			<p>Many mural-painting collectives, including most of those that grew out of the largely white- counterculture and anti-war movements, either start with women who then invite male artists
				in, or simply include both women and men. Often led by women with roots in Marxism and feminism, these collectives tend to be strongly anti-sexist, anti-imperialist, and to use overtly
				political images in their artwork. One of these groups was the Peoples Painters of New Jersey, who "muralized" Livingston College from 1972 to 1974. Modeled after the Ramona Parra Bri¬
				gades of Allendes Chile, the Peoples Painters were concerned equally with the political ef¬ fects of their murals and with trying to over- come individualism and a sense of personal
				ego. Their first wall was for the Livingston Women's Center which was very appropriate since the founders of the group--Julia Smith, Kathy Jones, and myself--considered ourselves
				activists in the Womens Liberation Movement. We worked on the design collectively, discuss- ing ideas first and then finding the images. We chose to work in a simple style, using heavy
				black outlines and flat color so that the women at the Center could help us paint. We also con¬ sciously worked over parts of the mural that others had originated to combat the
				tendency to say at the end of the project, "And this part is mine." While we did not wholly succeed in eliminating our sense of personal ego, we did find that by consciously
				emphasizing collec¬ tivity in our work we could overcome personal insecurities and achieve stronger political and artistic results. We went on to incorporate men into our group and
				painted eight other murals before agreeing to disperse in 1974, when some of our members graduated and others decided to go on to other things. </p>
			<p>The Haight-Ashbury Muralists in San Francis- co, a collective led by Jane Norling, see them- selves as "anti-imperialist cultural workers." Their first mural, Ralnbow People, was
				painted in 1972 as part of a large anti-war demonstra- tion. A Haight landmark, Ralnbow People was repainted and updated in 1974. Unfty Eye (1973) diagrams the ingredients for creating
				a revolu- tionary culture in the United States. The mural shows a revolution peopled and led by women, and was painted by an all-female team. Most recently, the Haight-Ashbury
				Muralists have been working on a 300-foot-long history of the class struggle in San Francisco. </p>
			<p>The most radical and problematic challenge to tradition has been the development of col- lective murals in which non-artist members of a community work with an artist-facilitator who
				heips them to create their own mural. While a strong emphasis on community participation characterizes all community mural projects, this particular emphasis reflects an attempt to
				create a "people's art" in every sense of the word. Simply providing paint and a wall to teen- agers and young adults is not the answer. There must be a direction, a method for working
				co¬ operatively, and a technique that makes it pos- sible to bypass the need for years of study of drawing and design. </p>
			<p>The most complete method, and the model for much related work elsewhere in the nation, was developed by Susan Shapiro-Kjok and the Cityarts staff in New York City. This method begins
				with a number of concept meetings dur¬ ing which the theme is discussed. In the early Cityarts Workshop murals, scenes were acted out and developed, photographed, and then projected
				and traced. When the mock-up was complete, it was enlarged by an opaque projec- tor and painted in. Black Women of Africa Today (1971), designed and executed by teen¬ age girls at The
				Smith housing project on the lower East Side, is typical of the early sithouette style. Later murals became more complex as the technique came to include the use of drawings and slides
				as well as photographs and the opaque projector. The jewish ethnic mural at the Bialystoker Old People's Home is a collage ofimages designed and painted by a group of Jewish teenagers
				under the direction of Susan Caruso-Green (current director of Cityarts Workshop). </p>
			<pb n="7"/>
			<p>Two other collective walls were painted in 1974 and 1975by lower East Side women under the direction of Tomie Arai. The Wal of Re¬ spect for Women (1974) epitomizes the non¬
				antagonistic type of feminism portrayed on non-white community walls dealing with the theme of woman. Rather than condemning more traditional womens roles (e.g. mother, telephone
				operator), this mural celebrates all the roles played by women. The second wall, Women Hold Up Halt the Sky (1975), palnted by many of the same women who worked or the earlier wall, as
				well as some men, portrays women's oppression within the context of the larger social struggle. Although most of the images come from a generalized women's ex- perience, the figures
				breaking out of oppression are of both sexes. In both walls women are shown performing their traditional jobs and, with few exceptions this is the way women are portrayed in community
				walls. </p>
			<p>Some murals about women emphasize the biological factor and almost all include the mother-child theme. Yet these would be con¬ sidered highly conservative images by the Womens
				Liberation Movement. The use of such stereotypical images of women is not the result of ignorance on the part of women mural- ists. In part it reflects the goals of Third World
				feminism, in which women's rights are seen as one part of the more general social struggle, and great care is taken to keep feminism from appearing to be a divisive force. </p>
			<p>Within political organizations like the Puerto Rican Socialist Party (PSP), political education courses discuss the need to overcome machis¬ mo and the oppressive role definitions which
				make it difficult for men and women to work together as companeros. Some of the verses from the song "Quiero decirte" (I Want to Tell You Something), written collectively by Suni Paz,
				Juana Diaz, and other Puerto Rican sisters in 1972 and often sung at political rallies and community events, state the changes in the male-female relationship for which they are
				struggling: </p>
			<lg>
				<l>A la mujer me dirijo: </l>
				<l>tu tambien debes luchar </l>
				<l>para salir de una vez </l>
				<l>de tu gran pasividad. </l>
			</lg>
			<lg>
				<l>Al hombre le toca ahora: </l>
				<l>entiende que la mujer </l>
				<l>sabe pensar y sentir </l>
				<l>y tiene derechoa ser.*</l>

				<l>you must struggle to abandon </l>
				<l>your conditioned passivity </l>
				<l>and to leave it behind.</l>
			</lg>

				<l>To the man I say </l>
				<l>try to understand </l>
				<l>that a woman can think and feel, </l>
				<l>and hasa right to exist.) </l>
			</lg>
			<p>The mother in Latin culture is seen as the moral leader of the household and the authority in the education of her children. The forced sterilization of women by the U.S. government in
				Puerto Rico and other Latin American coun¬ tries (as well as the poor at home) has served to intensify the felt need for women to bear chit¬ drenin order topreserve their race This
				creates certain differences in attitude about popula¬ ton control and the family structure between Third World feminism and the rest of the Vomens Liberation Movement. </p>
			<p>Overtly feminist murals are found primarlly on VVomen's Center walls within the university world, and in certain selected city neighbor hoods-Haght-Ashbury, for example-where a base of
				support exists. Most often, the feminist consciousness of women muralists is expressed bythesubstitution of female for male as asym- bolic or heroic figure, or even by the mere
				inclusjon of women as active figures in any mural.</p>
			<p>Theproblem of responsibility to the perma<pb n="8"/>the nent audience, those who have to live with art, isone with whichthecommunity muralist is constantly faced. Theideal is to
				work constant ly at the cutting edge of issues-neither too fan ahead nor too far behind. This is a continda struggle involving a constant series of difficuft decisjons and has been
				adirect part of my own fecent experience as a muralist. After severa years of working in a relatively radicalized uni¬ versity setting, ! undertook some murals in a very different
				environment-a conservative small town in the Adirondack mountains. My problem was how to paint a bicentennial mura that would be accepted by the permanent resi- dents as their history
				and yet not violate my convictions, orthetruth. justas 1began work in early 1976, the very town authorities who were my sponsors whitewashed a youth mural on ecology 1had directed in
				1974, which was criti¬ cal of the towns dumping sewage into the Schroon River Iconceived my design asacom¬ promise: the ancestors of the present residents are shown as workers in the
				logging industry, the saw mill, and the textile factories-a work- ing-class history, but one with only positive images. I began painting the wall with great misgivings. It was the
				reaction of the Wocals, and their enthusiastic hunger for their own his¬ tory, that made me realize that it is not just minority-group people or urban ghetto residents who have been
				deprived of their history and their rightto their own art expressjon, but every segmentof Americas working people. </p>
			<p>Communication between muralists around the nation has increased greatly since 1974. Three major mural conferences have occurred and the exchange of information and tech¬ niques has
				furthered experimentation. Many nuralists who previously worked alone have begun to experiment with collective techniques and vice versa. In 1975, for example, five muralists from the
				Chicago Mural Group (Cary! asko Mitchell Caton, Celia Radek, justine DeVan, and lucyna Radycki) worked on a co- ectively designed and painted wall. Prescrip- ton for Cood Heath Care.
				The muralists were a mixed group-racially, sexually, andin terms of previous mural experience. This was their first collectively designed wall, although they had helped each other to
				paint on other walls. The ocation at 5/th and Kedzie is near the head- quarters of the American Nazi Party in Chicago. Initially, there was some fear that racial attacks might prevent
				the group from working, but there were no disturbances during the time the mural was being painted. Acceptance in this white working-class neighborhood of a racially mixed group of
				muralists reflects the prestige that murals have achievedin Chicago. </p>
			<p>The continuing attempt at collectivity and away from the individualistic "genius" concept of the artist prevalent in the art world has been one of the major distinctions pioneered by
				women in the mural movement; it derives at least in heinfuenceofthea part fromt eas." on Movement. The O the wome, structures of the early womens organizations a5 V vell as the direct
				experience of conscious- ness-raising groups with the sisterhood and support they provided, became a part of the outlook of a number of the women muralists The changes resulting from
				their individua ex¬ periences with Womens Liberation led them to bring the same egalitarian and collective prac¬ tices to the mural groups they joined or heped found. </p>
			<p>While ideas from feminism and Mardsm are mplicitin theattemptto create a peoples art¬ especially in murals by women-the level of politicization and consciousness among mural¬ sts varies
				greatly. Most community murallsts, however ifthey were familiar with Maos words atthe Venan forum, would agree that: Intheworldtoday all cufture, all literature and art belong to
				definite ciasses and are geared to definite political lines. There isin fact no such thing as Art for arts sake, art that stands above classes, art thatis detached from or independ-
				entofpolitics. </p>
			<p>If that is true, one must choose-and they have chosen. </p>
