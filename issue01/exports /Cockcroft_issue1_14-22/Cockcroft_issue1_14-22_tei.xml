				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>Boston (Adele Seronde and Summerthing), New
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>Vork (Susan Shapiro-Kiok and Cityarts), and Los
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>Angeles (Judy Baca and Citywide) have been
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>initiated and directed by women artists, who
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>have given these programs much of their char¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>acter and philosophy. Women have led school

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>in collectives, women have increasingly dom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>inated the mural movement as a force for non¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>elitism, collectivity, and the practice of so¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>cial philosophies ranging from humanism to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>Marxism.

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>tions of neighborhood residents began as part of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>the more general social upheaval of the 1960s.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>Artists found themselves dragged into the social
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>arena and forced to consider questions beyond
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>those of pure form. By the late 1960s they could
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>no longer avoid confronting questions concern¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>ing the relevance, audience, and uses of their
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>art. A number of movements arose that tried to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>enlarge the audience and scope of contempo¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>rary art. Minority-group and politically active
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>artists felt both a demand and an opportunity to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>create an art responsive to their special heritage
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>and relevant to their own ethnic group, com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>munity, or movement. Mainstream artists at¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>tempted to bring art out of the museums and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>into the cities in the form of urban super¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>graphics, environmental sculptures, street¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>works, and happenings. Out of the coincidence
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>of these social and artistic forces the communi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>ty mural movement began in 1967-68.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>The mural movement took on different forms
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>in different locations, depending on which par¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>ticular combination of social forces spurred its
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>beginnings. The first mural in Chicago, the 1967
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>Wall of Respect, was painted by 21 Black artists
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>from the Organization of Black American Cul¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>ture (ÖBAC) and celebrated Black history and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>culture. It was a political-art happening involv¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>ing musicians and poets who played and read as
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>the painting progressed. Although women art¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>ists participated in the Wall of Respect, they
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>were not among those who continued the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>movement in Chicago and went from the OBAC
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>wall to paint in Detroit.

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>(1970) served as the token of women&apos;s participa¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>tion in the Chicago mural movement. Green
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>was 17, a high school dropout, when she saw
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>William Walker painting the Peace and Salva¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>tion Wall of Understanding near the Cabrini¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>Green projects where she lived. After watching
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>for a time, she asked Walker for paints and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>brushes and on a storage shed nearby painted
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>portraits of famous Black women from Aunt
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>Jemima to Angela Davis. Almost immediately
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>afterwards, the wall was defaced with large
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>splashes of white paint, practically the only de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>facement in Chicago up to that time. When
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>Green saw what the vandals had done, she com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>mented, &quot;Before, it was just a pretty picture,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>but it says more now.&quot; In general, though, dur¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>ing those early years women found their place
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>largely as assistants and apprentices in one of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>the two major community-based Chicago mural
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>groups: Public Art Workshop, led by Mark
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>Rogovin, and Chicago Mural Group, a multi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>ethnic coalition led by William Walker and John
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>Weber.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>In Boston, on the other hand, women played
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>an important role in introducing the mural idea.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>Boston artist Adele Seronde’s proposal calling
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>for the use of neglected city sites to transform
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>the city into a museum was the start. Through
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>the collaboration of Kathy Kane of the Mayor&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>Office of Cultural Affairs, the Institute of Con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>temporary Art, a number of Black artists, and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>Seronde, Summerthing was launched. It was the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>largest and most productive of the early mural
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>programs, beginning in 1968 and peaking in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>1970. The Summerthing program combined ele¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>ments of three distinct phenomena which had
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>emerged the preceding year—the renaissance in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>Black culture (Wall of Respect), the &quot;Summer in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>the City Paint-in Festival&quot; and various clean-up
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>programs, and the desire of environmental art¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>ists to work in urban spaces. Summerthing
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>sponsored Black Power murals, children&apos;s play¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>ground and pocket-park projects, and decora¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>tive walls—all within a framework allowing for
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>neighborhood control. Under Seronde&apos;s direc¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>tion, the program emphasized the sociological
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>rather than the decorative aspect of public art.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>Many impressive walls were painted from 1968
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>to 1970, especially in the Black communities of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>Roxbury and South End-including the first

				<lb facs='#facs_2_region_1657073949635_52l4' n='N004'/>like Green, Yasko was introduced to the mural

				<lb facs='#facs_2_region_1657073949635_52l6' n='N006'/>volunteered as a parent-assistant for a mural he
