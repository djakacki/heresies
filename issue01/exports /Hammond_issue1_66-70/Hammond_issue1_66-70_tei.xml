				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1656358493568_74l1' n='N001'/>There are many articles written on feminist

				<lb facs='#facs_2_region_1656358573389_92l2' n='N002'/>tures, has been abstract. I&apos;m thinking of the

				<lb facs='#facs_2_region_1656358573389_92l4' n='N004'/>and needlework women have created. Many of

				<lb facs='#facs_2_region_1656358573389_92l8' n='N008'/>the pattern resulting from its repetition. Usually
				<lb facs='#facs_2_region_1656358573389_92l9' n='N009'/>these motifs and patterns were abstract and
