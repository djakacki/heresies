         Ten Ways of Looking at Prison Lunch
				<persName>Gloria Jensen</persName></head>
				<p>(With apologies to Wallace Stevens)
			</p>
         <p>1. With both hands over your eyes, releasing
				one hand slowly to peep.
				2. Through the eyes of a friend you have by
				the hand—who reads braille.
				3. In the bing [solitary] where you can refuse
				to have the thing brought in at all and just lie
				there and sleep.
				4. From across the steam line, where people
				marvel at your petite body (if only they knew
				it's not by <emph>choice</emph> you prefer to remain frail and
				cautious).
				5. From a prison visitor's point of view — when
				suddenly, miraculously, all one sees is steak,
				greens and potatoes.
				6. From your window late at night as you
				watch one man run with a rake, followed by
				another with a sack, followed by a corrections
				officer, followed by a ruckus you've not seen
				but heard — then all three returning, dragging
				a heavy sack.
				7. Witnessing something come ashore in the
				bay and thinking: my, but it gave up a great
				fight.
				8. Wondering why they have signs saying DO
				NOT PEE ON THE GRASS. Then seeing the
				kitchen girls go out, mow it down and bring it in.
				9. Good Friday—when all the world's
				generous and the relief truck pulls up to the
				kitchen door to drop off loads of potatoes they
				couldn't unload anywhere else.
				10. Seeing more clearly the lunch of steak,
				greens and potatoes—as you attack the steak
				first and realize the fight you witnessed (#6) is
				not yet over, for the beast is biting you now too.
