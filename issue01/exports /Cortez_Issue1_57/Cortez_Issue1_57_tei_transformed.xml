				<p></p>Do you think this is a sad day
			
         <p>a sad night
				full of tequila full of el dorado
				full of banana solitudes
				And my chorizo face a holiday for knives
				and my arching lips a savannah for cuchifritos
				and my spit curls a symbol for you
				to overcharge overbill oversell me
				these saints these candles
				these dented cars loud pipes
				no insurance and no place to park
				because my last name is Cortez
				Do you think this is a sad night
				a sad day
				And on this elevator
				between my rubber shoes
				in the creme de menthe of my youth
				the silver tooth of my age
				the gullah speech of my one trembling tit
				full of tequila full of el dorado
				full of banana solitudes you tell me
				i use more lights more gas
				more telephones more sequins more feathers
				more iridescent head-stones
				you think i accept this pentecostal church
				in exchange for the lands you stole
				And because my name is Cortez
				do you think this is a revision
				of flesh studded with rivets
				my wardrobe clean
				the pick in my hair
				the pomegranate in my hand
				14th street delancey street 103rd street
				reservation where i lay my skull
				the barrio of need
				the police state in ashes
				drums full of tequila full of el dorado
				full of banana solitudes say:
				Do you really think time speaks english
				in the mens room
				Jayne Cortez was born in Arizona and grew up in the Watts
