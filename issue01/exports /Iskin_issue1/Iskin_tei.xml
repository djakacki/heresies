				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>In early summer of 1975 1 was asked by the

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>Opportunity of Aerospace Corporation to cu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>rate an exhibition of women&apos;s art on the subject
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>of female experience. This seemed to me to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>offer the potential of reaching a broad audience
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>and avoiding the defensive reactions often at¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>tached to &quot;feminist art“ or &quot;female sensibility“
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>in the art world.&apos; This art has been at the heart
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>of an ongoing, often heated controversy which
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>has clouded the issues and obstructed direct
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>perception of the work.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>Female experience has been the starting point
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>for the new art created by feminists since 1969.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>Consciousness raising and other forms of wom¬

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>initiated as a result of the women&apos;s movement,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>made female experience a rich source of subject
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>matter and sparked the fresh energy with which
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>women are making art. For the show I selected
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>the work of 15 L.A. artists? to represent both a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>broad scope of women&apos;s experiences and a di¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>versity of media, ranging from large environ¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>mental pieces to paintings, drawings, photog¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>raphy, prints, collage, assemblage, and artists&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>books. In an attempt to build a bridge between
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>the art and the creators&apos; intentions, I request¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>ed written statements from the artists, which,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>along with biographical information, were
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>available in a folder in the exhibition area.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>The exhibition was on view from August 18th
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>through September 5th in the Cafeteria Confer¬

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>tion. It was the first exhibition of professional
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>art on the company&apos;s grounds, preceded only by
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>shows of art by employees. Although sponsored
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>and funded by the corporation, the show was
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>initiated by feminist employees who conceived
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>it to offer &quot;insight into the emotional aspects of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>contemporary women.“3 They scheduled it to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>coincide with Women&apos;s Week, a program fea¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>turing prominent speakers and entertainers.

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>new policies for hiring women in order to meet

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>government funds. Women are in the minority,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>constituting only 25% of the roughly 3,200
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>Aerospace employees. Most of them (80%-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l53' n='N053'/>85%) are in lower-echelon clerical and secre¬
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>tarial positions; only a few rank among the engi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>neers, scientists, or chief administrators. The
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>company was, no doubt, hoping that the art ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>hibition and the activities of Women&apos;s Week
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>would go on record as testimony to their new¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>found good will toward women. Much to my
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>surprise, and to the dismay of the sponsors, the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>exhibition became the focal point of hot de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>bate. Violent emotional reactions, protest and.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>support quickly assumed the dimensions of a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>local scandal and echoed for months in letters
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>to the editor in The Orbiter, the company&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>newspaper.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>The art in the exhibition offered a feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>point of view on subject matter usually treated
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>from a male perspective. Though one might
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>assume that the controversial responses arose
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>out of an alienation from contemporary art
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>forms, it seems that the conflict stemmed pri¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>marily from feminist content.5 None of the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>works included were blatantly political protest
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>art, yet they all reflected, to varying degrees, a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>new feminist consciousness. It was this con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>sciousness —judging from the reactions of many
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>of the female viewers—that was unfamiliar
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>and threatening.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>We are accustomed to think of political art as
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>crude, illustrative, or plainly propagandistic, in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>contrast to &quot;good/serious/modernist&quot; art. It has
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>of course been pointed out that no art is entirely
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>disconnected from its historical, political, cul¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>tural, and geographical environment, and that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>therefore any art reflects these conditions.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>However, feminist art is often labeled political
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>art because the consciousness it reflects is held
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>by a minority, and it is at odds with the tacit
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>beliefs of those in power. The label &quot;political
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>art“ is used to demean the work rather than to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>evaluate its artistic significance.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>In a recent interview with Judy Chicago, the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>artist articulated her thoughts and feelings
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>about these issues:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>The issue of politics for me arises at the point
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>where my work interfaces with culture; it does
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>not arise at the point of origin in my studio.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>never think about politics when ! make my art;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>rather 1 think about being true to my own im¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>pulses, and for a woman to be true to her own
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>impulses is, at this point in history, a political
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>act.... What ! challenge is the idea that mas¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>culinity is inherently better than femininity;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l52' n='N052'/>that hardness is better than softness, that de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l53' n='N053'/>fensiveness is better than vulnerability, and

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>that violence is better than sharing. The asser¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>tion of womanhood is a challenge to all these
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>values that allow war dehumanization, rape,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>and art that lacks relationship with reality to

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>Faith Wilding elaborated on the relation be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>tween personal and political change:
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>It has always been a tenet of the feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>movement that the personal is political. It is
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>political because when a person becomes
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>transformed, enters into public experience,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>and infuses her own experience into the public,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>the world becomes transformed for her but in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>addition she then has the possibility of trans¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>forming the world. We have witnessed too
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>many people who are in politics who have
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>never experienced any kind of personal change
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>or real vision.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>What specifically triggered the controversy?
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>The art in the exhibition included a wide range
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>of feminist work: parodies on public images of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>women (Helen Alm Roth and Carole Caroom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>pas); private images of women and interior
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>spaces (Margaret Neilson); women&apos;s self-images
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>integrated with their historical and mythologi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>cal references (Judy Chicago and Faith Wilding);
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>references to women&apos;s vulnerability, powerless¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>ness, and powerfulness (Astrid Preston); relics
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>of admired female figures as magic talismans
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>(Hazel Slawson); communal efforts (Maria
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>Karras); and the quilt/grid pattern and color
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>pink seen as tributes to women&apos;s collaborative
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>forms (Sheila de Bretteville).
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>In her tableau environment Remnants in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>Homage to Lily Bart from Edith Wharton&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>House of Mirth, Nancy Youdelman &quot;recon¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>structed&quot; a scene from the book with theatrical
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>grandeur and presence. The tableau represents
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>the climax of Wharton&apos;s novel, when Lily Bart,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>having lost her wealth and status kills herself.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>Hauntingly life-like, her full-size figure, bearing
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>the artist&apos;s own features reclines in bed. Her
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>skin tone is grayish and the sleeping drops that
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>caused her death are by the side of her bed. The
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>tloor is cluttered with remnants of her life:
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>letters photographs delicate laces dresses,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>corsets, and veils. Youdelman creates metaphors
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>(sleep, passivity, death) for what have been
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>essential aspects of female experience: eco¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>nomic dependence on others, lack of ultimate
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>control over one’s own life, victimization by
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>circumstances. In the guise of a 19th-century
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>tragedy, Lily Bart&apos;s story is emblematic for
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>women who have remained powerless in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>society.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>In Youdelman&apos;s photographic series Leaves: A
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>Self Portrait, the artist is lying on the ground,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>gradually being covered with leaves (from pho¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>tograph to photograph) until she is entirely

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l2' n='N002'/>or like a sleepwalker, something that could just
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l3' n='N003'/>disappear and 1 think that is that powerless¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l6' n='N006'/>the leaves; it is about death and one could
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_6_1l7' n='N007'/>suppose that it might also mean renewal.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_7_1l4' n='N004'/>often been used in the history of (male) art to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_7_1l5' n='N005'/>entice the spectator by reminding him of his
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_7_1l6' n='N006'/>vertical superiority. However Youdelman&apos;s tab¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_7_1l7' n='N007'/>leau successfully evokes the solemn empathy of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_7_1l8' n='N008'/>the viewer who is confronted with the victims
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_7_1l9' n='N009'/>feelings about her powerlessness.

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_7_1l20' n='N020'/>sees her work as a manifestation of how women
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_7_1l21' n='N021'/>are perceived when they take an active role in a

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>depicts Fragonard-inspired images of her own
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>baby as a cherub floating in an infinite blue
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>California sky. &quot;Wherever they go, they have no
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>choice in it. ... The heavenly vision in which
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>they appear is both ideal and it is limbo.&quot; This
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>reflects Scheer&apos;s own experience as a first-time
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>mother:
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>found the child very sensual. It was unex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>pected to me what a strong female biological
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>experience it was to have a child, and then to be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>absolutely in love with the child. In the course
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>of using her as model, however, 1 made her
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>cry, sometimes neglected her, and in a way
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>used her, both as a model and as inspiration.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/> was aware that the art that makes it in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>L.A. or made it at the time (two years ago) was
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>non-image-oriented and I am very image¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>oriented. 1 was also entirely aware that show¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>ing babies in one&apos;s art was really outrageous
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>and it gave me a devilish pleasure, because
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>think that a lot of art that makes it is empty
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>formula and doesn’t have any blood in it; it is
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>not daring and it is not a turn-on either. So it
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>was like breaking a taboo, and especially for a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>woman artist.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>Like Scheer Gilah Hirsch deals with female
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>power within its traditional domain. She uses
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>the imagery of food as &quot;a secret biography, a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>metaphorical code.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>The shape and color of food itself was so com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>pletely right and ripe for my own feelings that
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>it became a symbol for me; especially the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>tomato strawberry, and egg became symbols
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>for myself. These are expressed in scale and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>potency; it is a strange word to use in relation¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>ship to an egg, a potent egg. The strawberry
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>is one of the few fruits that carries its seed on
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>the outside, it is a vulnerable fruit; it is juicy
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>and has strength and vulnerability at the same
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>time. Rather than feminist, these paintings
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>are, 1 think, more expressive of femaleness. It
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>was a personal statement for me....l can&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>separate my experience from a female experi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>ence; 1 feel powers in me, very specifically in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>certain centers in me.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>Suzanne Lacy&apos;s book Rape Is (1972) has a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>white cover which becomes bloody red on the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>inside. To open the book one must tear apart a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>red sticker labeled &quot;rape.“7 Lacy&apos;s book names
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>21 instances of rape—not only as a sexual viola¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l22' n='N022'/>tion but also as a series of psychological as¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l23' n='N023'/>saults:
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l24' n='N024'/>Rape is when you are skipping home from
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l25' n='N025'/>school, and are surrounded suddenly by a gang
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l26' n='N026'/>of large boys. Rape is when the man next door
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l27' n='N027'/>exposes himself and you feel guilty for having
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l28' n='N028'/>looked. Rape is when you&apos;re walking alone,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l29' n='N029'/>thinking your own thoughts and a man driving
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_5_1l30' n='N030'/>by shouts &quot;HI SWEETIE!&quot;

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>The traditional representation of rape in art
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>(with the exception of Kollwitz8) represents the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>experience of the rapist by focusing on his
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>strength, activity and beauty, and further re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>moves rape from a realistic experience through
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>mythological disguise. Lacy first forces the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>viewer to enact a metaphorical rape (&quot;deflower¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>ing&quot; the book by tearing the sticker) and then
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>confronts the viewer with what rape means to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>its victim.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>In Karen Carson&apos;s drawings of beds (1971-75)
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>woman is the bed. The drawings are expression¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>istic in style and imagery, powerful as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>satirical statements about the myth of happi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>ness in sexual relationships. In this case, too,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>the &quot;disturbing“ feminist content of Carson&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>drawings arises from the art-historical tradition
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>of reclining female figures on beds and sofas.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>Many of these women become an integral part
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>of the inanimate, passive, yet sexually inviting
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>surface on which they are reclining. Unlike
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>males Carson identifies with the oppressed—
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>the woman/bed—and at the same time, as art¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>ist, she takes active charge of that surface, pen¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>etrates it with a giant screw (Screw), converts it
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>into a carton of eggs (Fasy Lay), severs it with a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>saw blade (Edge of Night), or crowns it with a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>giant camera (Fasy Shot).
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>These surreal visualizations are take-offs on
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>popular puns, which function as titles and were
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>often the starting points for the drawings. The
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>series began as a macabre though humorous
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>comment on popular sexist consumerism. What
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>emerges is a violent denunciation of sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>roles, until finally the bed—former haven of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>consumer pleasure—disintegrates from within
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>(Cracking Up and Shattered Dreams), smashing
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>any illusions we might still have about bed and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>woman. In these most recent drawings the for¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>merly inanimate object erupts uncontrollably,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>and its fragments fly into space. What is com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>monly labeled Women’s Liberation is in fact, as
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>Carson expresses it, an excruciatingly painful
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>process beginning with the recognition of exte¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>rior oppression, leading to the experience of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>oppression from within and finally building
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>toward a complex re-integration—represented
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>by the artist&apos;s new work—collages in which the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>torn and mutilated fragments are reunited on a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>cohesive surface.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>would say that these drawings were intention¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l22' n='N022'/>ally propagandistic.... It had to do with con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l23' n='N023'/>sumer and sexual politics. The frame of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l24' n='N024'/>mind that ! was in when I did these drawings
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l25' n='N025'/>was severe frustration over treatment by men.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l26' n='N026'/>The drawings were also politically charged
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l27' n='N027'/>for me because ! talked about them to all kinds
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l28' n='N028'/>of groups from Valley housewives to a con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l29' n='N029'/>tinuation high school culture-hour class;
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_5_1l30' n='N030'/>thought people would be bored by these draw¬
			</p>
			<pb n='6'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>ings and they weren’t. They seemed to have a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>good time, and related to the drawings im¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>mediately. Now, it is not necessary to have a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>good time when viewing art, but there was
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>blanket recognition of the issues.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>When 1 looked in the newspaper I noticed
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>that you could apply sexual politics, directly or
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>indirectly, to almost every image in the adver¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>tisement world; every image implies sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>oromises. My original fantasy was that ! would
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>have enough money to take out a full page ad
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>in the L.A. Times, and just change the images
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>a little bit. Obviously the most political thing
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>about that was my fantasy about how many
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>people 1 could reach that way. It is the nature
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>of good political art to be recognizable and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>understandable by a lot of people and maybe
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>at a visceral level too. Political art is often
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>satirical, and probably most effective at that
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>level.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>The exhibition provided an opportunity to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>witness the heightened impact of contemporary
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>feminist art when viewed by a &quot;non-art“ audi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>ence—a cross-section of middle America that
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>normally would not encounter art, and specifi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>cally by a female audience alienated from femi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>nism. (The negative response came primarily
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>from women 9) It can also be seen as a test case
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>for implementing a long-desired goal —bringing
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>art into a public daily work environment.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>Had the show at Aerospace been exhibited in
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>any number of established or alternative gallery
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>spaces, it probably would not have caused un¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>usual debate, and certainly it would not have
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>prompted any doubt about the artistic merit of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>the work.10 In the Cafeteria Conference Rooms
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>of Aerospace, however, the exhibit infiltrated a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>male environment that ordinarily would not dis¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>play women&apos;s work made from a feminist per¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>spective and certainly would not give it public
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>acclaim. The work was predominantly consid¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>ered scandalous: it engendered passionate ob¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>jections and firm negative judgments. The show
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>was labeled pornography rather than art by
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>people who were unlikely ever to have consid¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>ered what is or isn’t art.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>This disclaimer was the protesters&apos; attempt to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>dismiss such threatening and upsetting mate¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>rial. Casting it as pornography implied that the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>art lacked any real esthetic value and therefore
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>need not be taken seriously. The level of naive¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>té of the critical responses—when opposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l53' n='N053'/>the more sophisticated criticism to which we
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l54' n='N054'/>are accustomed from much of the art world—
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l55' n='N055'/>was refreshing in its directness. One letter of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l56' n='N056'/>protest stated:
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l57' n='N057'/>1 object to the Art Exhibition. 1 find it de¬

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l59' n='N059'/>find it extremely offensive. 1am unable to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l60' n='N060'/>lower my sights to the gutter level of this ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l61' n='N061'/>hibit. In my opinion, it is lewd, vulgar, obscene
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l62' n='N062'/>and immoral. Since when did good taste and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l63' n='N063'/>modesty go out-of-style?11

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>in poor taste, bad character, and a definite

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>The Aerospace Corporation has drastically

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>America, we enjoy being treated as a woman

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>the organized women&apos;s movement. Confronted
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>by art that dealt with an oppression familiar in
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>most of their lives, real images that did not

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>dream presented a powerful threat.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>The art was perceived as offensive precisely
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>because it was not placed in a neutralizing en¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>vironment like a gallery, where viewers can
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>easily hide behind anonymity. The art invaded
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>their own daily working sphere where it threat¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>ened how they were viewed in their professional
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>positions. Brought into the work context, the art
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>reflected more directly upon them. The height¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>ened emotional reactions caused a strong need
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>to disassociate themselves verbally from the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>picture of womanhood presented in the show.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>While identification with female experiences

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>virtually impossible when introduced into a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>work environment dominated by male values
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>and power. Such an environment, by implica¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>tion, and as a condition for the possibility of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>working there, demands a woman&apos;s identifica¬

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l54' n='N054'/>own oppression. To admit that what was ex¬

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l60' n='N060'/>admitting publicly to an embarrassing, private

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>The Art Exhibition, a high quality collection

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>In thinking now about this exhibition, 1 realize
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>that it was unrealistic to expect an enthusiastic
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>reception, or even acceptance, for art like this
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>among female viewers who were not already
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>feminists or somewhat sympathetic to femi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>nism. It might have seemed that the work was
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>not perceived for what it was—but on the con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>trary it was in fact accurately perceived, and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>found objectionable. Such response is typical
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>when feminism is introduced into a male¬
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>dominated culture.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>For those women at Aerospace who were
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>sympathetic to feminism, the exhibition was a
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>positive experience providing a new awareness
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>of the existence of women&apos;s culture created by
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>contemporary feminists. In that sense the ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>hibition did broaden the audience for contem¬
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>porary feminist art. For some of these women
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>who previously had no particular interest in art,
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>the exhibition was a beginning of what has since
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>become an ongoing interest and commit¬

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>am still thinking about one piece in the show
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>which 1 would like to own if 1 had money.
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>decided that if 1 bought art, it would be wom¬

				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>Earlier that same summer, my colleagues and
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>in the Feminist Studio Workshopls had come
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>to a collective definition of feminist art based
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>on our goals, experiences and observation of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>our students&apos; work. We defined the function of
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>feminist art as raising consciousness inviting
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>dialogue, and transforming culture. It became
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>clear to me that both the individual art exhibited
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>at Aerospace and the exhibition as a whole in
				<lb facs='#facs_7_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>fact realized these goals to the extent that was

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>to women&apos;s situation is that workers who (consciously
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>or unconsciously) feel powerless in their jobs deny the
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>pain of their experiences if its expression would jeo¬

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>first explored their oppression in the private, safe, and

				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>model of workers&apos; oppression does not ultimately ad¬
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>dress itself to women&apos;s oppression, beyond that of
				<lb facs='#facs_8_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>working-class women. For an extensive analysis of
