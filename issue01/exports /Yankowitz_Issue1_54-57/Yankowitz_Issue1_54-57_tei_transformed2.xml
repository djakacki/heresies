				AN APPLE
				Manuelo Manchik admires the apple before de-
				vouring it. He cups the thing in the palm of his
				hand, turning it this way and that; the light
				bounces off the curves of its golden skin. O
				golden delicious, you make a mouth water! The
				fruit is round and firm and fully packed; unlike
				the mealy banana, it will resist his teeth just a
				little. Again his mouth waters as he delays the
				coming pleasure. He cups the thing in the palm
				of one hand, stroking it with the other; it is
				smooth and cool beneath his fingers. O golden
				delicious, you do tempt a man! Yes there is no
				doubt, you were made to be eaten. He opens
				his mouth wide and chomps through to the core
				in a single bite. Two black seeds slither in a rill
				of juice down his chin.
			</p>
         <p>
				BREASTS
				At a gathering of talents, artistic and profane,
				MM had spotted across the crowded room his
				own dreamed-of Olympia, half-reclining on a
				fat settee. The exquisite naturalness of her
				Manet pose enchanted him no less than her
				near nudity. Under her see-through blouse her
				breasts were classic. O wonder. O no wonder
				that they pushed out the silk (or was it cheap
				nylon?) of her blouse exactly like breasts; that
				to exploring hands (at other hours of course for
				now she was half-reclining naturally alone) they
				were as round and firm and full as round firm
				full breasts; and that the nipples which tipped
				these breasts resembled nothing so much as the
				nipples which tip such breasts. In short and in
				sum, her breasts were truly like breasts. But MM
				had no interest in the obvious. He was a man of
				imagination, of poetry even. The excesses of
				similitude multiplied by their exact number his
				pleasures. He saw what he saw: Olympia with
				breasts which were breasts and at the same time
				various other roundnesses not breasts. And
				roundness was all, preferable even to that com-
				monplace of literature, ripeness. Only one fact
				was crucial and he had ascertained it, subtly
				brushing his fingers against her shoulders: she
				was not made of wax. So when MM opened his
				mouth wide one night days later and bit with
				gusto into the breast on the left, that same
				breast bled. Damn, he had erred in his distinc-
			</p>
         <p>
				tions! But Manuelo Manchik was not a man to
				hang fire. With a gesture of magnificent un-
				concern, he wiped his chin and continued
				eating.
			</p>
         <p>
				CHYME
				Olympia had accepted that name, accepted too
				the play of tongue and teeth, accepted even the
				discomfort of her body crushed beneath him
				when poing! she was punctured. Too late to cry
				foul! she fell, undone by mastication. Softened
				by saliva she travelled in mouthfuls through his
				gullet and into the fat sac of his stomach. There
				she lodges, divided against herself.
				Fool, she chides herself, to have come to
				chyme!
				Her head is separated from her body. Her legs,
				each in one long piece, are severed from her
				crotch and from each other, Her two loose
				breasts bounce from wall to wall, free-floating,
				as his stomach contracts and dilates in diges-
				tion. Pressed against the locked pyloric door
				sheisgrateful at least that she will not be further
				fractured by the cleaving peristaltic actions of
				his intestine. There is no disguising the situa-
				tion: she is split, sundered, she is not in one
				piece. If she does not want to sour in his belly
				(and why would she desire such a fate?) she
				must somehow (but how?) reverse the process
				herself. But herself is not. From deep inside
				Manuelo's stomach, she surveys the chaos of
				her members and thinks: I must pull myself
				together!
			</p>
         <p>
				DREAM?
				Maybe it's all a dream, she reasons reasonably
				enough, and when I wake up I'll find myself me
				again, just me, no one's Olympia, in toto. And
				so she falls to sleep so she can fall awake. This is
				the dream she finds: she is standing in water
				being fucked in the ass by the shameless beak of
				a crane. His long legs pinion her hips. He wades
				and fishes, taking his time. It hurts. What can
				she do but submit? Her name is not Leda; the
				power is all his.
			</p>
         <p>
				ESCAPE
				She wakes up gagging with her left foot in her
				mouth. No use sucking on the toes, they're not
				sour balls, they won't dissolve or sweeten her
				palate. Her mouth is dry with sleep and anxiety;
				she could have suffocated during that night-
				time shift. There is no escaping the fact now:
				she must escape! But how? She wags her head a
				few times to float the foot free as she ponders
				the ins and outs. The nearest exit is the rear.
				Can she deliver herself through there? MM is
			</p>
         <pb n="2"/>
         <p>
				notoriously tight-assed. She experiments, jam-
				ming her foot in the door; MM jumps. Assured
				of the flexibility of that aperture, she glances
				upward to the other hole, further away but far
				less foul. Keeping her foot wedged in the crack
				she sticks a finger up his throat; MM gags.
				Both routes are open to her.
				Which out should she take?
			</p>
         <p>
				FLATULENCE
				MM ejects a fart and holds his nose in indigna-
				tion. The cream of the art world thins around
				him. Many noses are held. How could she, the
				bitch, upset him so? He excuses himself grace-
				fully from the room, leaving his smell behind. Is
				he stuck with her forever? Must he pay with his
				immaculate reputation for one night's over-
				indulgence? O she is lodged there in his gut,
				forcing him to take strong measures.
			</p>
         <p>
				GLUTTONY
				"I'd like to eat you up," he had said. She had
				been enthusiastic. Whose sin was it then? Defi-
				nitely food for thought, his and hers.
			</p>
         <p>
				HIS AND HERS
				HIS: She tempted me.
				HERS: He ate.
			</p>
         <p>
				INDIGESTION
				"I'm carrying her around. She weighs me down.
				Really, I'm not a free man anymore," Manuelo
				confided to his friend the doctor, picking his
				teeth with an indigestible sliver of fingernail.
				"You must get her out of your system," replied
				the learned doc. "May I prescribe a laxative?"
			</p>
         <p>
				JUSTICE MORE OR LESS POETIC
				She hadn't cared who drove into her. He had
				had a full set. It was good sport yes. And what
				a ball! He had swung hard, lifted high and,
				rimming the cup first with a brilliant display of
				control, had dropped right in: hole in one,
				Mandelo Manchik was not the sort to putter
				around. Well, neither was she.
				"You're a real swinger," he complimented her.
				"Just par for the course, she replied, refering
				of course to her life.
				Now she was teed-off, finding herself in the
				trap. O she had been green in those green days,
				but she would lie in the roughage no longer.
				With a method to her madness she slices into
			</p>
         <p>
				his intestine with her teeth. MM howls then
				doubles over, squeezing her (according to plan)
				more closely together; his cramp adheres her.
				When he straightens up she delights to see the
				connections: her legs secured to her groin and
				her groin to her torso, o classic venus though
				still not Olympia for her breasts and arms are
				still somewhere adrift. And her head, that ob-
				stinate be-bumped ball, is lying slightly off-
				course, planning the next shot.
			</p>
         <p>
				KIDDING
				When she reached twenty-five, her psychiatrist
				had said (though gently): "All kidding aside, my
				dear, you are no longer a child prodigy."
				She had run home crying to her mother, blurt-
				ing the tragic news. "So? What are you going to
				do with yourself?" mother had asked, heart-to-
				heart.
				"I gotta grow up sometime, ma. He's right. So
				here's what: I'm gonna have a baby!"
				"What? What?" disbelieving ma had hollered,
				flinging her daughter from her sacked-out
				breast. "I'm going to have a bastard?"
				"No, ma, no," she calmed her mother. "<hi rend="italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;">I'm</hi>
				gonna have the bastard."
				The child was born crying and one gulp of air
				later, died. The bereaved not yet a mother in-
				vited her psychiatrist to the funeral and told
				him then and there that they were quits. That
				was how he would remember her: standing
				gravely at the grave, dressed all in black, a
				grown-up color.
			</p>
         <p>
				LIKE
				"I like you," MM had said (as had others), think-
				ing to flatter.
				"No you're not," she retorted almost at once,
				angry almost. "You're not like me at all."
			</p>
         <p>
				MILK OF MAGNESIA
				He takes the prescribed dosage and waits.
			</p>
         <p>
				NO ANSWERS
				In the park, Abigale is lying on her belly, wait-
				ing as pre-arranged for her best friend, the
				putative Olympia. She pokes with a spring twig
				at the underside of a caterpillar, trying to hurry
				it out of its skin.
				"Where are your wings, caterpillar?" she asks.
				"And where was I before I was born?"
				"And where, sky, do you get off, looking down
				on me?"
				Everything is mute. The silence is its own
				question.
			</p>
         <pb n="3"/>
         <p>
				OSCILLATIONS
				Suddenly everything starts churning. Using all
				anchored organs for ballast, she holds herself
				together; he will not shake her up, will not frag-
				ment her. His belly bloats with gases, goes into
				a rumble. So! He is trying to purge himself by
				purging her. The rejection infuriates her. She
				will come out when she is good and ready, and
				she will use the exit of her choice. Tough shit,
				Manuelo! She braces hersef against his spasms.
			</p>
         <p>
				P'S &amp; Q'S
				"Mind them!" her mother had warned. But what
				were they? She had learned the alphabet thor-
				oughly but the deeper meanings of p's and q's
				had eluded her. If she had gone further in her
				study of letters, would she have led a simpler
				life?
			</p>
         <p>
				REFLECTION
				MM strains.
				O resists.
				The battle is in earnest. Some old words rise to
				the occasion. "The man who hates you and the
				woman who is hated are probably one and the
				same," her psychiatrist had suggested, madden-
				ing her (at the time) into silence.
				Was he speaking of suicide?
				Hers?
				The thought sobers her and sheds light. After
				all, it is almost spring out there. The crocuses are
				already beginning their day-open night-close
				ritual. She could if she chose walk outside with-
				out a coat, breathing sunlight. Someone, also
				without a coat, might be coming round the cor-
				ner fated to bump chests with her. Her mind
				too, she realizes, can turn corners. And certainly
				Abigale, her old friend, must be waiting for her in
				the park this very moment.
			</p>
         <p>
				SURE IS
				His stomach is storming around her with a ven-
				geance. She holds on for dear life. O yes, it is so
				so dear, good old life. It is indeed of the es-
				sence, hers in particular. Her imagination has
				never yet failed her. She will live! Out of the
				darkness the closet, the belly of this male
				whale. The way is lighted by divine coincidence
				as MM opens his mouth widely to expel a belch.
				The light rays down his throat, a sign. Her route
				has been decided. Really, there are possibilities
				in everything, even a belch, she concludes.
			</p>
         <p>
				TRANSLATION (AFTER RILKE)
				Manuelo has thrown caution to the winds. "Do
				something," he pleads. "I need help."
				"Yes," agrees the doctor, "you must change
				your life."
				O but it hurts! His eyes are blind with tears.
				Manuelo weeps with the effort to restrain them.
			</p>
         <p>
				UNITED SHE CAN
				He falls back into his chair, trying to relax, inad-
				vertently giving her the room she needs to ma-
				neuver. She holds herself snugly in her own
				arms; they mate with their respective sockets,
				home at last. Now able to manipulate with her
				hands, the rest is easy. She catches her drifting
				breasts and fixes them onto her chest. She knows
				which is which, having observed in moments of
				self-criticism that the left is slightly larger than
				the right. It occurs to her at this juncture that
				nature is purposive in all plans. Nothing is very
				much like anything else, each thing is essentially
				itself and under no compulsion to be other.
				Goodbye then, Manuelo's Olympia! Goodbye
				velvet settee and languid pose! MM's ass presses
				down into the seat, squeezing her upward. Her
				body rises toward her head and miraculously
				naturally unites with it. He cannot keep her
				down. He does not want to. She is on her way.
			</p>
         <p>
				VOYAGING
				Still afraid that she will fall apart â these connec-
				tions are so tenuous, so untested â she kicks her
				feet, gingerly at first, then with increasing vigor
				as she finds to her elation that they will move
				her. She paddles upward toward his heart. O the
				current there is strong; she struggles bravely; she
				falters, sucked into its vortex; she kicks, she flails
				and manages, through stratagems newly known
				to science, to bypass the whole throbbing mass.
				The worst is over. She catches her breath at his
				lungs and then, with a great final spurt, dives
				through his esophagus.
			</p>
         <p>
				WHOOPS!
				She spills out of his mouth.
				"Hi, Manuelo."
				"Olympia!"
				They stand gaping at each other, both of them
				messy with blood and other slime. She sets him
				straight at once. "My real name's Claire. Can I
				take a shower?"
			</p>
         <pb n="4"/>
         <p>
				x =
				Claire, not Olympia then. He looks at her in this
				new light as he scrubs her back. How could he
				not have noticed those pimples on her shoul-
				ders? Perhaps that is why he was unable to
				stomach her. But no, no, the mystery is more
				than skin deep.
				"Scrub harder, Manuelo."
				He does, marveling at the dead skin which peels
				off, flake by flake. How many layers are there?
				He stares into the skin, lost in ponderings
				beneath the surface and then, with a wild cry of
				exultation, realizes that he has found his calling.
				Dermatology will teach him the topography of
				the flesh. Through that mundane profession he
				will explore the twin mysteries of desire and
				disgust.
				"You're breaking the skin again!" shouts Claire.
				"Enough!"
			</p>
         <p>
				YOU
				"You have helped me to find myself," they ad-
				mit simultaneously and, with a tender embrace,
				part forever.
			</p>
         <p>
				ZOON
				Shining in the sunlight which is shining too, she
				runs to the park. Abigale is asleep; a caterpillar
				is making a moustache on her upper lip. Claire
				picks it off and tosses it carelessly into the grass.
				It slithers away as Abigale wakes.
				"Where have you been?" drowsy A asks. Claire
				hesitates. What words could convey the ab-
				surdity, the enormity of her adventure? An
				attempt is necessary. She begins to stammer a
				reply but her stomach, miraculously to the
				rescue, speaks first: loudly it rumbles, fiercely it
				growls. Both women laugh. The noise suffices
				for response.
				Claire stretches out her hands to Abigale and,
				with a little tug, pulles her to her feet.
				"It's time for another beginning," Claire says.
				"It always was," Abigale grins.
				And off they go, old friends hand in hand, in
				search of apples.
