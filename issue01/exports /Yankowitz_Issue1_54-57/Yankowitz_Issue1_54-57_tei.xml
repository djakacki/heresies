				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l2' n='N002'/>Manuelo Manchik admires the apple before de-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l3' n='N003'/>vouring it. He cups the thing in the palm of his
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l4' n='N004'/>hand, turning it this way and that; the light
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l5' n='N005'/>bounces off the curves of its golden skin. O
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l6' n='N006'/>golden delicious, you make a mouth water! The
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l7' n='N007'/>fruit is round and firm and fully packed; unlike
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l8' n='N008'/>the mealy banana, it will resist his teeth just a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l9' n='N009'/>little. Again his mouth waters as he delays the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l10' n='N010'/>coming pleasure. He cups the thing in the palm
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l11' n='N011'/>of one hand, stroking it with the other; it is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l12' n='N012'/>smooth and cool beneath his fingers. O golden
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l13' n='N013'/>delicious, you do tempt a man! Yes there is no
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l14' n='N014'/>doubt, you were made to be eaten. He opens
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l15' n='N015'/>his mouth wide and chomps through to the core
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l16' n='N016'/>in a single bite. Two black seeds slither in a rill
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121979552_210l17' n='N017'/>of juice down his chin.

				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l2' n='N002'/>At a gathering of talents, artistic and profane,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l3' n='N003'/>MM had spotted across the crowded room his
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l4' n='N004'/>own dreamed-of Olympia, half-reclining on a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l5' n='N005'/>fat settee. The exquisite naturalness of her
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l6' n='N006'/>Manet pose enchanted him no less than her
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l7' n='N007'/>near nudity. Under her see-through blouse her
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l8' n='N008'/>breasts were classic. O wonder. O no wonder
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l9' n='N009'/>that they pushed out the silk (or was it cheap
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l10' n='N010'/>nylon?) of her blouse exactly like breasts; that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l11' n='N011'/>to exploring hands (at other hours of course for
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l12' n='N012'/>now she was half-reclining naturally alone) they
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l13' n='N013'/>were as round and firm and full as round firm
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l14' n='N014'/>full breasts; and that the nipples which tipped
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l15' n='N015'/>these breasts resembled nothing so much as the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l16' n='N016'/>nipples which tip such breasts. In short and in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l17' n='N017'/>sum, her breasts were truly like breasts. But MM
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l18' n='N018'/>had no interest in the obvious. He was a man of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l19' n='N019'/>imagination, of poetry even. The excesses of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l20' n='N020'/>similitude multiplied by their exact number his
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l21' n='N021'/>pleasures. He saw what he saw: Olympia with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l22' n='N022'/>breasts which were breasts and at the same time
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l23' n='N023'/>various other roundnesses not breasts. And
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l24' n='N024'/>roundness was all, preferable even to that com-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l25' n='N025'/>monplace of literature, ripeness. Only one fact
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l26' n='N026'/>was crucial and he had ascertained it, subtly
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l27' n='N027'/>brushing his fingers against her shoulders: she
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l28' n='N028'/>was not made of wax. So when MM opened his
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l29' n='N029'/>mouth wide one night days later and bit with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l30' n='N030'/>gusto into the breast on the left, that same
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121991053_213l31' n='N031'/>breast bled. Damn, he had erred in his distinc-
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121999907_216l1' n='N001'/>tions! But Manuelo Manchik was not a man to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121999907_216l2' n='N002'/>hang fire. With a gesture of magnificent un-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121999907_216l3' n='N003'/>concern, he wiped his chin and continued
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657121999907_216l4' n='N004'/>eating.

				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l2' n='N002'/>Olympia had accepted that name, accepted too
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l3' n='N003'/>the play of tongue and teeth, accepted even the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l4' n='N004'/>discomfort of her body crushed beneath him
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l5' n='N005'/>when poing! she was punctured. Too late to cry
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l6' n='N006'/>foul! she fell, undone by mastication. Softened
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l7' n='N007'/>by saliva she travelled in mouthfuls through his
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l8' n='N008'/>gullet and into the fat sac of his stomach. There
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l9' n='N009'/>she lodges, divided against herself.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l10' n='N010'/>Fool, she chides herself, to have come to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l11' n='N011'/>chyme!
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l12' n='N012'/>Her head is separated from her body. Her legs,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l13' n='N013'/>each in one long piece, are severed from her
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l14' n='N014'/>crotch and from each other, Her two loose
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l15' n='N015'/>breasts bounce from wall to wall, free-floating,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l16' n='N016'/>as his stomach contracts and dilates in diges-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l17' n='N017'/>tion. Pressed against the locked pyloric door

				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l19' n='N019'/>fractured by the cleaving peristaltic actions of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l20' n='N020'/>his intestine. There is no disguising the situa-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l21' n='N021'/>tion: she is split, sundered, she is not in one
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l22' n='N022'/>piece. If she does not want to sour in his belly
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l23' n='N023'/>(and why would she desire such a fate?) she
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l24' n='N024'/>must somehow (but how?) reverse the process
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l25' n='N025'/>herself. But herself is not. From deep inside
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l26' n='N026'/>Manuelo&apos;s stomach, she surveys the chaos of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122003974_219l27' n='N027'/>her members and thinks: I must pull myself

				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122007224_222l1' n='N001'/>DREAM?
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122007224_222l2' n='N002'/>Maybe it&apos;s all a dream, she reasons reasonably
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122007224_222l3' n='N003'/>enough, and when I wake up I&apos;ll find myself me
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122007224_222l4' n='N004'/>again, just me, no one&apos;s Olympia, in toto. And
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122007224_222l5' n='N005'/>so she falls to sleep so she can fall awake. This is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122007224_222l6' n='N006'/>the dream she finds: she is standing in water
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122007224_222l7' n='N007'/>being fucked in the ass by the shameless beak of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122007224_222l8' n='N008'/>a crane. His long legs pinion her hips. He wades
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122007224_222l9' n='N009'/>and fishes, taking his time. It hurts. What can
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122007224_222l10' n='N010'/>she do but submit? Her name is not Leda; the

				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122017358_225l2' n='N002'/>She wakes up gagging with her left foot in her

				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122017358_225l5' n='N005'/>palate. Her mouth is dry with sleep and anxiety;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122017358_225l6' n='N006'/>she could have suffocated during that night-

				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122017358_225l8' n='N008'/>she must escape! But how? She wags her head a

				<lb facs='#facs_1_region_1657122017358_225l10' n='N010'/>the ins and outs. The nearest exit is the rear.

				<lb facs='#facs_2_region_1657122035347_231l5' n='N005'/>less foul. Keeping her foot wedged in the crack
				<lb facs='#facs_2_region_1657122035347_231l6' n='N006'/>she sticks a finger up his throat; MM gags.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_region_1657122035347_231l7' n='N007'/>Both routes are open to her.

				<lb facs='#facs_2_region_1657122038968_234l6' n='N006'/>fully from the room, leaving his smell behind. Is

				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l2' n='N002'/>Claire, not Olympia then. He looks at her in this
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l3' n='N003'/>new light as he scrubs her back. How could he
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l4' n='N004'/>not have noticed those pimples on her shoul-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l5' n='N005'/>ders? Perhaps that is why he was unable to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l6' n='N006'/>stomach her. But no, no, the mystery is more
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l7' n='N007'/>than skin deep.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l8' n='N008'/>&quot;Scrub harder, Manuelo.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l9' n='N009'/>He does, marveling at the dead skin which peels
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l10' n='N010'/>off, flake by flake. How many layers are there?
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l11' n='N011'/>He stares into the skin, lost in ponderings
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l12' n='N012'/>beneath the surface and then, with a wild cry of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l13' n='N013'/>exultation, realizes that he has found his calling.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l14' n='N014'/>Dermatology will teach him the topography of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l15' n='N015'/>the flesh. Through that mundane profession he
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l16' n='N016'/>will explore the twin mysteries of desire and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l17' n='N017'/>disgust.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l18' n='N018'/>&quot;You&apos;re breaking the skin again!&quot; shouts Claire.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122184835_294l19' n='N019'/>&quot;Enough!&quot;

				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l3' n='N003'/>runs to the park. Abigale is asleep; a caterpillar
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l4' n='N004'/>is making a moustache on her upper lip. Claire
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l5' n='N005'/>picks it off and tosses it carelessly into the grass.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l6' n='N006'/>It slithers away as Abigale wakes.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l7' n='N007'/>&quot;Where have you been?&quot; drowsy A asks. Claire
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l8' n='N008'/>hesitates. What words could convey the ab-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l9' n='N009'/>surdity, the enormity of her adventure? An
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l10' n='N010'/>attempt is necessary. She begins to stammer a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l11' n='N011'/>reply but her stomach, miraculously to the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l12' n='N012'/>rescue, speaks first: loudly it rumbles, fiercely it
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l13' n='N013'/>growls. Both women laugh. The noise suffices
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l14' n='N014'/>for response.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l15' n='N015'/>Claire stretches out her hands to Abigale and,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l16' n='N016'/>with a little tug, pulles her to her feet.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l17' n='N017'/>&quot;It&apos;s time for another beginning,&quot; Claire says.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l18' n='N018'/>&quot;It always was,&quot; Abigale grins.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l19' n='N019'/>And off they go, old friends hand in hand, in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_region_1657122192105_300l20' n='N020'/>search of apples.
