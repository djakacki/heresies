				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>In this essay, I am using the term erotic not
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>as a self-evident, universal category, but as a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>culturally defined concept that is ideological in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>nature. More specifically, I am arguing that the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>modern art that we have learned to recognize
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>and respond to as erotic is frequently about the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>power and supremacy of men over women.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>Indeed, once one begins to subject erotic art to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>critical analysis, to examine the male-female
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>relationships it implies, one is struck with the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>repetitiousness with which the issue of power is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>treated. The erotic imaginations of modern
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>male artists—the famous and the forgotten, the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>formal innovators and the followers—re-enact
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>in hundreds of particular variations a remark¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>ably limited set of fantasies. Time and again,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>the male confronts the female nude as an ad¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>versary whose independent existence as a physi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>cal or spiritual being must be assimilated to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>male needs, converted to abstractions, en¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>feebled or destroyed. So often do such works
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>invite fantasies of male conquest (or fantasies
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>that justify male domination) that the subjuga-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>tion of the female will appear to be one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>primary motives of modern erotic art.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>In Delacroix&apos;s Woman in White Stockings
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>(1832), for example, an artist&apos;s model (i.e., a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>sexually available woman) reclines invitingly on
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>a silken mattress. The deep red drapery behind
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>her forms a shadowy and suggestive opening.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>The image evokes a basic male fantasy of sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>confrontation, but the model does not appear
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>to anticipate pleasure. On the contrary, she
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>appears to be in pain, and the signs of her
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>distress are depicted as carefully as her alluring
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>flesh. Her face, partly averted, appears dis¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>turbed, her torso is uncomfortably twisted, and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>the position of her arms suggests surrender and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>powerlessness. But this distress does not contra¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>dict the promise of male gratification. Rather, it
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>is offered as an explicit condition of male
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>pleasure—the artist&apos;s and the viewer&apos;s.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>The equation of female sexual experience
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>with surrender and victimization is so familiar
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>in what our culture designates as erotic art and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>so sanctioned by both popular and high cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>traditions, that one hardly stops to think it odd.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>The Victorian myth that women experience sex
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>as a violation of body or spirit or both, and that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>those who actively seek gratification are per¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>verse (and hence deserving of degradation), is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l52' n='N052'/>but one of many ideological justifications of the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l53' n='N053'/>sexual victimization of women devised by the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>modern era. In the 20th century, the theory and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>practice of psychology has given new rationali¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>zations to the same underlying thesis.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>The visual arts are crowded with images of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>suffering, exposed heroines—slaves, murder
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>victims, women in terror under attack, be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>trayed, in chains, abandoned or abducted.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>Delacroix&apos;s Death of Sardanapalus (1827), in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>spired by a poem by Byron, is a tour de force of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>erotic cruelty. Ingres&apos; Roger and Angelica (1867)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>also depicts woman as victim. Here, an en¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>dangered and helpless heroine—naked, hairless
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>and swooning—is chained to a large, phallic¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>shaped rock, immediately below which appear
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>the snake-like forms of a dragon. This fantastic
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>but deadly serious statement documents a com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>mon case of male castration anxiety. But the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>artist-hero (he is Ingres-Roger) masters the situ¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>ation: he conquers the dangerous female geni¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>tals. First he desexualizes Angelica—reduces
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>her to an unconscious mass of closed and bone¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>less flesh; then he thrusts his lance into the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>toothy opening of the serpent—Angelica&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>vagina transposed. Given the fears such an
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>image reveals, it is no wonder that Ingres ideal¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>ized helpless, passive women. The point here,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>however, is that neither Ingres&apos; fears nor his
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>ideal woman were unique to him.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>Americans, too, thrilled to images of female
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>victims. Hiram Power&apos;s The Greek Slave (1843)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>was probably the most famous and celebrated
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>American sculpture in the mid-19th century.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>Overtly, the viewer could admire the virtuous
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>modesty with which Powers endowed the young
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>slave girl, as did critics in the 19th century; but
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>covertly, Powers invites the viewer to imagine
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>himself as the potential oriental buyer of a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>beautiful, naked, humiliated girl who is literally
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>for sale (he specified that she is on the auction
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l40' n='N040'/>block). The narrative content of this sculpture
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l41' n='N041'/>supports the same underlying thesis we saw in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l42' n='N042'/>the Delacroix: for women, the sexual encounter
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l43' n='N043'/>must entail pain and subjugation, and that sub¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l44' n='N044'/>jugation is a condition of male gratification. But
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l45' n='N045'/>even in paintings where nudes are not literally
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l46' n='N046'/>victims, female allure is treated in terms related
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l47' n='N047'/>to victimization. For Ingres, Courbet, Renoir,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l48' n='N048'/>Matisse and scores of other modern artists,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l49' n='N049'/>weakness, mindlessness and indolence are at¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l50' n='N050'/>tributes of female &apos;sexiness. Germaine Greer&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l51' n='N051'/>description of the female ideal that informs
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l52' n='N052'/>modern advertising could as well have been
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l53' n='N053'/>drawn from modern nudes:
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>Her essential quality is castratedness. She ab¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>solutely must be young, her body hairless, her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>flesh buoyant, and she must not have a sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>organ.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>That is, in the modern era, woman&apos;s desirability
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>increases as her humanity and health (relative
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>to male norms) are diminished.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>The need to see women as weak, vapid,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>unhealthy objects-—while not unique to the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>modern era—is evidently felt with unusual
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>intensity and frequency in bourgeois civiliza¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>tion, whose technical advances so favor the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>idea of sexual equality. Indeed, as women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>claims to full humanity grew the more relent¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>lessly would art rationalize their inferior status.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>For while literature and the theatre could give
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>expression to feminist voices, the art world
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>acknowledged only male views of human sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>experience. In that arena, men alone were free
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>to grapple with their sexual aspirations, fanta¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>sies and fears. Increasingly in the modern era,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>artists and their audiences agreed that serious
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>and profound art is likely to be about what men
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>think of women. In fact, the defense of male
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>supremacy must be recognized as a central
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>theme in modern art. Gauguin, Munch, Rodin,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>Matisse, Picasso and scores of other artists,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>consciously or unconsciously, identified some
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>aspect of the sexist cause with all or part of their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>own artistic missions. Art celebrating sexist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>experience was accorded the greatest prestige,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>given the most pretentious esthetic rationales
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>and identified with the highest and deepest of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>human aspirations.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>Nudes and whores—women with no identity
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>beyond their existence as sex objects—were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>made to embody transcendent, &quot;universally
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>significant statements. In literature as in art, the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>image of the whore even came to stand for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>woman in her purest, most concentrated form,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>just as the brothel became the ultimate class¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>room, the temple in which men only might
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>glimpse life&apos;s deepest mysteries: &quot;A Henry
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>Miller, going to bed with a prostitute [in Tropic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>of Cancer], feels that he sounds the very depths
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>of life, death and the cosmos.&quot;2 Picasso&apos;s fa¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>mous brothel scene, the Demoiselles d’Avignon
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>(1907), where the viewer is cast as the male
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>customer makes similar claims—claims that art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>historians advocate as &quot;humanistic“ and uni¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>versal.3 Art-making itself is analogous to the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l52' n='N052'/>sexual domination of whores. The metaphor of
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>the penis-as-paintbrush is a revered truth for
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>many 20th-century artists and art historians. It
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>also insists that to create is to possess, to domi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>nate, and to be quintessentially male.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>try to paint with my heart and my loins, not
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>bothering with style (Vlaminck).4
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>Thus I learned to battle the canvas, to come to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>know it as a being resisting my wish (dream),
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>and to bend it forcibly to this wish. At first
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>it stands there like a pure chaste virgin and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>then comes the willful brush which first here,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>then there, gradually conquers it with all the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>energy peculiar to it, like a European colonist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>...(Kandinsky).
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>The kind of nudes that prevail in the modern
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>era do not merely reflect a collective male
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>psyche. They actively promote the relationships
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>they portray, not only expressing but also shap¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>ing sexual consciousness. For the nude, in her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>passivity and impotence, is addressed to women
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>as much as to men. Far from being merely an
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>entertainment for males, the nude, as a genre,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>is one of many cultural phenomena that teaches
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>women to see themselves through male eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>and in terms of dominating male interests.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>While it sanctions and reinforces in men the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>identification of virility with domination, it
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>holds up to women self-images in which even
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>sexual self-expression is prohibited. As ideology,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>the nude shapes our awareness of our deepest
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>human instincts in terms of domination and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>submission so that the supremacy of the male
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>&quot;&quot; prevails on that most fundamental level of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>experience.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>Twentieth-century art has equally urged
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>the victimization and spiritual diminution of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>women, shedding, however the narrative trap¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>pings and much of the illusionism of the 19th
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>century. The abandoned Ariadnes, endangered
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l40' n='N040'/>captives and cloistered harem women of 19th¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l41' n='N041'/>century art become simply naked models and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l42' n='N042'/>mistresses in the studio or whores in the broth¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>The image of the femme fatale, especially
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>popular at the turn of the century, would seem
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>to contradict the image of woman as victim.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>Typically, she looms over the male viewer, fix¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>ing him with a mysterious gaze and rendering
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>him will-less. Yet she is born of the same set of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>underlying fears as her powerless, victimized
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>sisters, as the depictions often reveal. Munch&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>Madonna (1893-94), a femme fatale par excel¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>lence, visually hints at the imagery of victimiza¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>tion. The familiar gestures of surrender (the arm
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>behind the head) and captivity (the arm behind
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>the back, as if bound) are clearly if softly stated.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>These gestures have a long history in Western
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>art. The dying Daughter of Niobe, a well-known
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>Greek sculpture of the 5th century B.C. exhib¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>its exactly this pose. The raised arm is also seen
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>in numerous 5th-century statues of dying Ama¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>zons and sleeping Ariadnes, where it conveys
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>death, sleep or an overwhelming of the will. It
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>may also convey the idea of lost struggle, as in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>the Amazon statues or in Michaelangelo&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>Dying Captive (The Louvre), themselves master¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>pieces of victim imagery with strong sexual
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>overtones. But in the modern era, the raised
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>arm (or arms) is emptied of its classical conno¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>tation of defeat with dignity and becomes
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>almost exclusively a female gesture—a signal of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>sexual surrender and physical availability.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>Munch used it in his Madopna to mitigate his
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>assertion of female power; the gesture of defeat
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>subtly checks the dark, overpowering force of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>Woman. The same ambivalence can also be seen
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>in the spatial relationship between the figure
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>and the viewer: the woman can be read as rising
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>upright before him or as lying beneath him.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>However lethal to the male, the late 19th¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>century femme fatale of Munch, Klimt and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>Moreau ensnares by her physical beauty and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>sexual allure. In the 20th century, she be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>comes bestial, carnivorous and visibly gro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>tesque. In images of monstrous females by
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>Picasso Rouault, the Surrealists and de Koon¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>ing, the dread of woman and male feelings of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>inferiority are projected, objectified and univer¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>salized. Yet here too the devouring woman im¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>plies her opposite, combining features of both
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>the powerless and the threatening. The women
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>in Picasso&apos;s Demoiselles d&apos;Avignon, although
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>physically mutilated and naked (vulnerable),

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>gerous-looking bodies. Picasso ambivalently
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>presents them with sham and real reverence in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>the form of a desecrated, burlesque icon, al¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>ready slashed to bits. De Kooning, in his contin¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>uing Woman series, ritually invokes, objectifies
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>and obliterates the same species of goddess¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>whore. Here too a similar ambivalence finds its
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>voice in shifting, unstable forms whose emer¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>gence and destruction are accepted in the criti¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>cal literature as the conscious &quot;esthetic&quot; pretext
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>for his work. The pose his figures usually take—
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>a frontal crouch with thighs open to expose
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>the vulva—also appears in the Demoiselles
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>d&apos;Avignon (in the lower right figure), which, in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>turn, derives from primitive art. Like Picasso&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>figures, de Kooning&apos;s women are simultaneous¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>ly inviting and repelling, above and below the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>viewer obscene modern whores and terrifying
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>primitive deities.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>The pronounced teeth in de Kooning&apos;s Wom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>an and Bicycle (1950)—the figure actually has a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>second set around her throat—also speak of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>primitive and modern neurotic fears of the fe¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>male genitals. The vagina dentata, an ancient
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>fantasy into which males project their terror of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>castration—of being swallowed up or devoured
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>in their partner&apos;s sexual organs—is commonly
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>represented as a toothed mouth. The image,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>which appears frequently in modern art, is a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>striking feature of Mirö&apos;s Woman&apos;s Head (1938).
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>The savage creature in this painting has open
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>alligator jaws protruding from a large, black
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>head. The red eye, bristling hairs and exagger¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>ated palpable nipples, in combination with the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>thin weak arms, help give it that same mixture
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>of comic improbability and terribleness that
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>characterize Picasso&apos;s Demoiselles and de
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>Kooning&apos;s Women. But in addition—and true to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>Mirö&apos;s love of metamorphosing forms—the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l40' n='N040'/>image can be read literally as the lower part of a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l41' n='N041'/>woman’s body, seen partly as if through an X
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l42' n='N042'/>ray. Inverted, the arms become open legs, the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l43' n='N043'/>dark, massive head a uterus, and the long, dan¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l44' n='N044'/>gerous jaws a toothed vaginal canal. The preda¬

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_4_1l46' n='N046'/>not only has saw-toothed jaws, but several fea¬

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>femme fatale. More subhuman and brutal than
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>her 19th-century predecessors, she testifies to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>the higher level of sexual anxiety and hostility
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>experienced by the 20th-century male. For as
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>women increasingly demanded a share of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>world, the defense of male authority became
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>more desperate:

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>formidable as when she faced man as a part of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>alien Nature. In place of the myth of the la¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>borious honeybee or the mother hen is substi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>tuted the myth of the devouring female insect:
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>the praying mantis, the spider. No longer is the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>female she who nurses the little ones, but
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>rather she who eats the male.6
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>Pictures of nudes in nature also affirm the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>supremacy of the male consciousness even
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>while they ostensibly venerate or pay tribute to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>women as freer or more in harmony with nature
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>than men. From the Bathers of Delacroix to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>those of Renoir and Picasso nude-in-nature
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>pictures almost always ascribe to women a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>mode of existence that is categorically different
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>from man&apos;s. Woman is seen as more of nature
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>than man, less in opposition to it both physi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>cally and mentally. Implicitly, the male is seen
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>as more closely identified with culture, &quot;the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>means by which humanity transcends the giv¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>ens of natural existence, bends them to its pur¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>poses, controls them in its interests.&quot;/
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>This woman/nature-man/culture dichotomy
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>is one of the most ancient and universal ideas
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>ever devised by man and is hardly new to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>modern Western culture. However, in Western
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>bourgeois culture, the real and important role
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>of women in domestic, economic and social life
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>becomes ever more recognized: increasingly,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>the bourgeoisie educates its daughters, de¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>pends upon their social and economic coopera¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>tion and values their human companionship.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>Above all, the idea that women belong to the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>same order of being as men is more articulated
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>than ever before. In this context, to cling to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>ancient notions of women as a race apart from
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>men—as creatures of nature rather than of cul¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>ture—is to defend blatantly an ideology that is
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>everywhere contested and contradicted by ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>perience. Nevertheless, the majority of nude-in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>nature pictures state just this thesis.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>In countless 19th- and 20th-century paintings

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>—Romantic, Symbolist or Expressionist—fe¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>male nudes in outdoor settings are treated as
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>natural inhabitants of the landscape. Although
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>modern artists have characterized it differently,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>they agree that this woman-nature realm is an
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>inviting but alien mode of experience. It both
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>attracts and repels the male. It beckons him to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>step out of rationalized, bourgeois society and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>to enter a world where men might live through
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>their senses instincts or imaginations. But the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>condition of entry—shedding the social identity
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>of the bourgeois male—also entails loss of au¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>tonomy and of the power to shape and control
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>one&apos;s world. The male artist longs to join those
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>naked beings in that other imagined realm, but
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>he cannot because he fails to imagine their full
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>humanity—or his own. While he values his own
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>instincts, or that part of himself that responds to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>nature, he regards this portion of his nature as
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>feminine,&quot; antagonistic to his socialized mas¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>culine ego and belonging to that other &quot;natu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>ral&quot; order. Nor can he acknowledge in women a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>&quot;masculine principle&quot;—an autonomous self
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>that knows itself as separate from and opposed
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>to the natural, biological world. Like Munch
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>before his Madonna, he hovers before his
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>dream in ambivalent desire.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>Rarely do modern artists imagine naked men
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>in that other realm. When they do, as in works
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>by Cézanne or Kirchner, the male figures tend
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>to look uncomfortable or self-conscious. More
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>often, the male in nature is clothed—both in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>the literal sense or metaphorically—with a so¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>cial identity and a social or cultural project. He
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>is a shepherd, a hunter an artist. Matisse&apos;s Boy
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>With Butterfly Net (1907) is a magnificent
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>image of a male in nature (or rather a male
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>acting against nature), highly individualized
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>and properly equipped for a specific purpose. In
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l40' n='N040'/>beach scenes by the Fauves and the Kirchner
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l41' n='N041'/>circle, males—when they are present—are not
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l42' n='N042'/>&quot;bathers&quot; i.e., placid creatures of the water,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l43' n='N043'/>but modern men going swimming in bathing
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l44' n='N044'/>suits or in the raw. They are active, engaged in a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l45' n='N045'/>culturally defined recreation, located in histori¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l46' n='N046'/>cal time and space. The female bather who has
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l47' n='N047'/>no counterpart in modern art, is a naked exis¬

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>herself with a touching grace of constancy and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>fidelity. .. . Nature is a woman. History, which
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>we very foolishly put in the feminine gender,

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>traveller... 8
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>Even in Matisse’s Joy of Living (1906), where
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>men and women share an Arcadian life, cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>activities (music-making, animal husbandry)
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>are male endeavors while women exist merely
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>as sensual beings or abandon themselves to

				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>neous dance.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>How we relate to these works becomes a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>compelling issue once their sexual-political
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>content is apparent. The issue, however, is diffi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>cult to grasp without first coming to terms with
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>the ideological character of our received no¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>tions of art. For in our society, art—along with
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>all high culture—has replaced religion (that is,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>among the educated) as the repository of what
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>we are taught to regard as our highest, most
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>enduring values. As sanctified a category as any
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>our society offers, art silently but ritually vali¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>dates and invests with mystifying authority the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>ideals that sustain existing social relations. In
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>art, those ideals are given to us as general,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>universal values, collective cultural experience,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>&quot;our&quot; heritage, or as some other abstraction
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>removed from concrete experience. Physically
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>and ideologically, art is isolated from the rest of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>life, surrounded with solemnity, protected from
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>moral judgement. Our very encounters with it
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>in museums, galleries and art books are struc¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>tured to create the illusion that the significance
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>of art has little or nothing to do with the con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>flicts and problems that touch common experi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>ence. Established art ideologies reinforce this
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>illusion. According to both popular and scholar¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>ly literature, true artistic imaginations tran¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>scend the ordinary fantasies, the class and sex
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>prejudices and the bad faith that beset other
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>human minds. Indeed, most of us believe that
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>art, by definition, is always good—because it is
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>of purely esthetic significance (and the purely
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>esthetic is thought to be good), or because it
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>confirms the existence of the imagination and
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>of individualism, or because it reveals other
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>&quot;timeless&quot; values or truths. Most of us have
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>been schooled to believe that art, qua art, if it is

			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>&quot;good&quot; art, is never bad for anyone, never has
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>anything to do with the oppression of the pow¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>erless, and never imposes on us values that are
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>not universally beneficial.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>The modern masterpieces of erotic art that!
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>have been discussing enjoy this ideological pro¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>tection even while they affirm the ideals of
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>male domination and female subjugation. Once
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>admitted to that high category of Art, they ac¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>quire an invisible authority that silently acts
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>upon the consciousness, confirming from on
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>high what social customs and law enforce from
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>below. In their invisible and hence unques¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>tioned authority, they proclaim—without ac¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>knowledging it—what men and women can be
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>to themselves and to each other. But once that
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>authority is made visible, we can see what is
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>before us: art and artists are made on earth, in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>history, in organized society. And in the mod¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>ern era as in the past, what has been sanctified
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>as high art and called True, Good and Beautiful
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>is born of the aspirations of those who are em¬
