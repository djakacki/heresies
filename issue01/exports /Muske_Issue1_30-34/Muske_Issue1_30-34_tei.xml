				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>In July 1973 I wrote an article for The Village
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>Voice about a hunger strike then taking place at
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>the Women&apos;s House of Detention (New York
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>City Correctional Institution for Women, hous¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>ing around 400 detention and sentenced wom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>en) on Riker&apos;s Island. I used a pseudonym for
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>the article because I was working at the time at
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>the prison as a mental health worker as well as
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>teaching a poetry class, and I wanted to keep
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>both occupations. Many of the women in my
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>class were involved in the strike and were em¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>phatic about the significance of their stand,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>although traditionally women at Riker&apos;s were
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>notoriously apolitical, even downright reaction¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>ary. Strikes had taken place before, but on is¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>sues such as cosmetics (the women had wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>an Avon lady), more dances and recreation time
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>or flashier products in commissary.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>This strike was different. The women were
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>demanding, among other things, a legal library,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>an end to massive and lax prescription of &quot;diag¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>nostic&quot; medication, decent food, and limitation
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>of solitary confinement to three days. At the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>Women&apos;s House, where an old adage ran &quot;all
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>riots end at mealtime,&quot; this was pretty heady
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>stuff.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>The article in The Village Voice (July 26, 1973)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>was supposed to get the world (or at least Man¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>hattan) listening and to familiarize people with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>a woman’s situation in prison:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>incarceration for women is a somewhat
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>different experience than it is for men. Male
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>prisoners are expected to be political in one
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>form or another, they are far better legally
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>informed, and an atmosphere of &quot;bonding&quot; is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>prevalent. (They are also considered more
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>&quot;trainable&quot;—more vocational rehab programs
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>exist for men on Riker&apos;s Island.)
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>The administration broke the back of the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>strike in its sixth day by separating the ringlead¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>ers, transferring them to different housing
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>areas, or locking them in the &quot;bing&quot; (solitary).
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>But it was too late. The article appeared and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>provoked a reaction from the community: pres¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>sure was put on the warden. A few of the wom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>en’s demands were met: a legal library was es¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>tablished, kitchen conditions were improved,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>and other steps were taken. Someone from the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>class hand-printed a sign and put it up in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>the classroom: WORDS CAN TURN THEM
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>AROUND.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>This was a milestone. I had been teaching
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>the class for about a year and felt that although
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>the women&apos;s response had been overwhelming¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>ly enthusiastic, I was getting nowhere in the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>actual teaching of writing. It wasn’t that the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>women were intimidated by the act of writing.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>Far from it. They wrote to keep mentally alive,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>to keep sane. When I first suggested the idea of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>a writing workshop to the warden, she scoffed
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>at it. &quot;These women don’t write,&quot; she said.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>&quot;They don’t read. The overall educational level
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>is poor. Reading, writing, comprehension... all
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>very low.&quot; At the first class, I learned that all the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>women &quot;wrote&quot;—they came to class lugging
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>diaries, journals, manuscripts full of long
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>poems, ballads, stories. Everyone had a poem
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>to &quot;tell“; poetry was a tradition; poems were
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>written, read, copied by hand, and passed
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>around—a publishing network. No one owned a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>poem. All the poems rhymed, and all were
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>either sentimental love/religious verse or politi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>cal rhetoric. My failure had been the inability to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>let them see alternatives: a poem was not
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>always an escape, a fantasy, or a slogan, but a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>way into yourself, an illumination. Somehow
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>the article, which was about them, about their
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>very real lives in clear, simple language, did it.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>Someone said that a poem could be like report¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>ing on your life, telling the story of your life—
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>journalism of the soul.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>They tried out this approach. Millie Moss,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>who sat all day in front of the television watch¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>ing commercials about getting away from it all
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>and listening to the planes (one every three
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>minutes) take off from La Guardia a few hun¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>dred yards across the water from the prison,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>wrote the first. (Millie had been a &quot;hearts and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>flowers&quot; verse writer: her poems were filled with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>giggly sunsets“):

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>So we ain’t home—
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>we’re together
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>Smile:
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>I take it personally
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>They were on fire. I told them about Mandel¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>stam, Dostoyevsky, the long tradition of writers
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>in prison. I read them poems. Another woman,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>Elizabeth Powell, came to class with a poem
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>about homosexuality which was explicit, hon¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>est, and skillfully done. The class praised it¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>Elizabeth left the class that night, made a sheaf
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>of copies by hand, and passed it &quot;on the vine.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>The next time I arrived at the prison, I was
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>called into the warden’s office. A member of my
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>class, the warden said, had written a poem
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>about her &quot;unique perversion&quot; and had implied,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>she said, that there were also correction offi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>cers who were homosexual, one in particular.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>She spoke of libel, telling me that I should have
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>confiscated the poem immediately, or at least
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>made sure that it didn’t go beyond the class.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>(Though homosexuality was indeed common—
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>the &quot;only game&quot; in the prison, the warden
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>steadfastly refused to admit that she had any
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>more than-a few &quot;deviants&quot; on her hands, whom
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>she described as hard-core—in other words, gay
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>even on the outside. Actually, as is the case in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>most women&apos;s prisons, homosexual relation¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>ships were standard even for straights, for the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>simple reason that human beings need physical
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>intimacy and affection when they are confined
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>to correctional institutions and cut off from
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>relationships available to them outside the walls.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>Definitions of personal sexuality tend to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>change behind bars. Upon release, some
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>women remain &quot;changed,&quot; while the majority
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>of former prisoners return to heterosexual life¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>styles. The warden deeply feared homosexuality;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>any manifestation of &quot;butch&quot; conduct was
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>enough to tag an inmate a troublemaker and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>&quot;male attire&quot; was expressly forbidden in the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>rules guide. Correction officers were warned
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>not to wear pants to work, and thus their uni¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>form remained skirted. (Although many C.O.&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>were, in fact, gay, the atmosphere reflected the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>warden&apos;s artificial notion of femininity.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>After this incident, I was informed that the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>poem had been confiscated and that Elizabeth
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>Powell had been placed in solitary confinement
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>pending a hearing by the disciplinary board. I
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>was told that I would be allowed to continue
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>the poetry class for the time being, but that if
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>another incident like this took place, I would be
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>asked to leave the prison. The warden sincerely
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>hoped that I had &quot;learned a lesson.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>I had. It was just as I had told them: a dra¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>matic testimony to the power of words—and,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>thought, one of the stupidest things I have ever
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>done. It was easy for me to drop in and talk
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>about &quot;getting it down right“ and being honest
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>in writing—I went home every night. For me,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>there was no danger of being thrown in solitary,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>having my personal papers raided, or worse. It
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>occurred to me that even when l had written my
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>ever-so-honest article, I had used a pseud¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>onym to protect myself. There were obviously
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>bigger risks than job loss at stake for women or
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>men who chose to write while incarcerated;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>risks l had clearly not understood. Words could
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>indeed turn around the authorities, but could
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>also turn them into the oppressors they actually
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>were.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>Elizabeth Powell was in the bing for three
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>weeks. When she came back to class, she was
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>ready to go another round (she had written 25
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>poems, all dealing with homosexuality, while in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>lock), but I had made a decision. I explained
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>how I felt as an outsider with no right to tell
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>them how to write in this volatile situation, but
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>I asked that they make a distinction between
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>public and private poems to protect themselves
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>from exactly this kind of censorship/punish¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>ment. Private poems were, obviously, ones you
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>could get thrown in the bing for; public poems
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>could be &quot;published.&quot; At this point, I also went

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>that that was a good way of viewing it.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>The class flourished. The women began to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>express themselves, to find words underneath
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>and in the midst of the gloss of everyday lan¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>guage. Some discovered (recovered?) a sub¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>terranean language like subway graffiti: the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>poem became a Kilroy, a zap: &quot;I was here.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>I had quit my mental health worker job and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>was concentrating on expanding FREE SPACE,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>as the class had come to be called. The NEA had
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>given us some funding, as did Poets &amp; Writers
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>and some local banks. Linda Stewart of The

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l54' n='N054'/>library and Ted Slate of Newsweek donated sup¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l56' n='N056'/>Tom Weatherly taught a second poetry class,

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>only ball points or pencils allowed).
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>Somehow, the class took place and thrived.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>Visitors came to read and comment on student
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>work: poets Mae Jackson, Daniela Gioseffi,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>Daniel Halpern, Audre Lorde. For a long time,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>everyone learned. Information was taken in,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>absorbed—classes were spent writing and re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>writing, letting off steam.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>Almost four years later, most of the women
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>from the old class had been transferred or freed
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>(detention women often spend two years wait¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>ing for trial), but emphasis was still placed on
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>getting along.&quot; We all stressed writing as craft.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>Classes were run as any outside workshop would
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>be, except no one ever published anything.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>The poetry class at this time was full of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>women who were considered potential security
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>threats—in other words, intelligent, outspoken,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>and funny. Some were &quot;controversial&quot; cases:
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>Juanita Reedy, about to have her first child
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>behind bars; Carole Ramer who had been
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>busted with Abbie Hoffman and who had a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>to say about everything; Gloria Jensen, whose
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>imagination was like a vaudeville show; Assata
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>Shakur/Joanne Chesimard—alleged leader of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>the Black Liberation Army, brilliant and tal¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>ented, with a Cool-Hand Luke aura of insou¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>ciance, compassion, and tenacity. (Assata was
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>considered so dangerous that the prison re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>quired her to have a continual guard-escort.)
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>These women were all good writers. They had
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>learned craft and practiced it—and wanted
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>more. They wanted to go further than &quot;thera¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>peutic&quot; writing or workshop poems. They were
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>writing dynamite.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>After four years, there was a huge pile of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>handwritten poems, Fannie&apos;s log with the names
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>of every woman who had come to class, some
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>incredible memories, and that was all. We went
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l53' n='N053'/>to the prison week after week and no one ever
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l54' n='N054'/>saw or heard what the women wrote: the voices
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l55' n='N055'/>were never heard outside, and on the inside,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l56' n='N056'/>only in class. I began to feel that something had
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l57' n='N057'/>to give—no matter what risks were involved for
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l58' n='N058'/>the women (if they should decide to publish)¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l59' n='N059'/>and for FREE SPACE as a writing program. It was
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l60' n='N060'/>Catch 22—we were losing either way. At this
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l61' n='N061'/>stage, the women were denied the natural ful¬
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l62' n='N062'/>fillment of self-expression, which is publication.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l63' n='N063'/>If we published their writing, however, we stood
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>to lose the writing program itself. I began to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>fantasize about getting the word out: if people
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>could only hear some of this stuff, I thought, no
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>one would ever ask me again about either the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>quality of prisoners&apos; writing or the reasons for
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>running workshops in prisons. We would have
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>evidence in writing. Best of all, the women
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>would have the audience they deserved. I began
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>to draft a rough script, a framework for some of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>the poems.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>What happened to Juanita Reedy made up
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>everybody&apos;s mind about publication. Juanita
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>went to Elmhurst Hospital to have her child and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>was treated so inhumanely that she refused to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>let prison doctors touch her upon her return.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>She wrote a poem about her experience, which
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>she developed into a longer &quot;Birth Journal.&quot; She
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>published it in Majority Report, the feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>journal. In the same issue there was an article
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>about FREE SPACE and a poem by Carole Ramer.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>The issue began to circulate in the prison.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>Assata, inspired by Juanita, wrote her own
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>&quot;Birth Journal&quot; and sent it to a major magazine.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>One night in class she read this poem:
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>Butch
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>You should have told me
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>About your dick
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>Stashed inside your bureau drawer
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>woulda believed you
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>Ya say ya wanna be my daddy
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>Va say ya wanna be my daddy
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>Ya say ya wanna be my daddy
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>Yeah! Run it! l&apos;m ready!
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>My mamma warned me about you
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>She taught me about you
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>She beat me about you
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>But I thought you were a man.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>And I lower my eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>And I lower my back
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>And I swivel my hips
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>And I lighten my voice
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>And I powder my nose
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>And I blue up my eyes
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>And I redden my cheeks
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>And I jump when you call
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>And I cook and I knit
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>And I clean and I sew
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>And it is all so cozy
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>You lying in my arms

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>too unladylike)
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>But who will know, anyway,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l53' n='N053'/>That you were in my arms

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>Writers gave us a grant to do an anthology of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>students&apos; writing which Gail and I compiled. We

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>the Corrections Department that we needed the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>videotape as a rehearsal tool for a play) and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>taped for nine hours straight. Finally, after
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>months of editing, a half-hour tape emerged
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>which documents the poems, songs, love, and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>exasperation of some of these incredible wom¬

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>In September 1975, FREE SPACE merged with
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>ART WITHOUT WALLS, another arts project for
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>women in prison. Now we were able to offer
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>graphic arts and dance, in addition to having a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>larger staff. The publishing idea had fulfilled
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>itself, a renaissance. Juanita had begun a book
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>about her experiences; another woman, Isabelle
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>Newton, was collecting her poems in manu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>script. Then Assata, who had been held in soli¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>tary for one year in New Jersey, whose cell was
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>raided by guards every day in search of contra¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>band, and who had been beaten by the prison
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>goon squad on numerous occasions, completed
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>her book of poems and wrote two chapters of a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>book, an account of her arrest and life in prison.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>The warden stopped me in the hall one day and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>told me that she knew we were collaborating on
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>a book with Assata and Juanita. She told me she
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>hadn’t forgotten the Elizabeth Powell case.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>On November 26, 1975, Gail was preparing to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>leave home to go to her fiction class (filled with
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>new students) when the phone rang. It was Dep¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>uty Freeman, the WHD Program Director, who
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>advised her not to come to class: the program
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>had been cancelled. We were not allowed to do
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>anything after that except to pick up our books
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>and any program belongings; we couldn’t say
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>good-bye to anyone or discuss plans for any of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>their work.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>Naturally, we are contesting this decision,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>but there isn’t much hope in appealing a war¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>den’s whim. It is, after all, her turf. Official
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l53' n='N053'/>reasons for the cancellation were said to be
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l54' n='N054'/>duplication of services (they stated that the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l55' n='N055'/>public school provided the same type of classes)
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l56' n='N056'/>and irregularity of classes. The warden refused,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l57' n='N057'/>however to put these reasons in writing for us.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l58' n='N058'/>It is clear that the writing classes were taken
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l59' n='N059'/>seriously only when the women wrote seriously
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l60' n='N060'/>about their lives and published those writings.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l61' n='N061'/>Poetry is safe, women are safe until they begin
