				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>In this essay, I would like to suggest where
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>feminism can lead us and what myths must
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>finally be left behind to get there. The nature of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>these myths—the myths of equality, individual-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>ism and democratic liberalism—which under-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>write our humanist heritage, account for the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>weakest elements of feminist ideology. The
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>recognition that feminism is an ideology, like
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>Marx&apos;s recognition that humanism is an ideolo-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>gy (i.e., not a discourse whose &quot;truth&quot; was in-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>separable from the world it described) is a nec-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>essary step in re-examining what feminism is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>and what it can do.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>I will use as a conceit the form of &quot;the contra-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>diction&quot;—that underlying, dynamic mechanism
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>of history—in a way that is sometimes more
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>metaphorical than concrete. I take the liberty of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>using this model rhetorically at times to begin
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>to establish a series of interrelationships be-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>tween ideologies and their culture. I use it to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>suggest the many ways the several spheres of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>interest to Heresies readers—art, feminism
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>and their political context—are subject to a set
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>of analogous and mutually reinforcing ideologi-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>cal myths. Most feminists and artists alike are
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>still held captive by the power of these seduc-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>tive belief systems, although they threaten the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>coherence of our arguments, threaten our inter-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>ests and threaten the very survival of the ideal
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>of freedom.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>A confrontation between the facts and fic-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>tions which surround us becomes inevitable
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>within an escalating spiral of contradictions.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>The first group to experience directly the essen-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>tial contradictions of the society we live in is, of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>course, the lowest class: the unemployed, the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>poorest, least skilled, most exploited working
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>people. Next, the marginal groups, in North
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>America: people of color, immigrants, the el-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>derly, etc. Artists are marginal too. They feel
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>the economic squeeze in recessions, may even
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>become politicized as a result. And across all
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>these groups are women. As groups, then, wom-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>en and artists have a low priority in the hier-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>archy of capital.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>To give up the humanist myths, those most
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>cherished ideals of our own class, the bourgeoi-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>sie, which were forged when it was the revolu-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>tionary class, is difficult indeed. But give them
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>up we must, for in the face of heightening con-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>tradictions-economic, biological, ideological
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>—we have no choice.

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>By 1976, the women&apos;s movement seems to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>have nearly as many political lines as there are
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>women in it. This partly healthy, partly disturb-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>ing fact reflects with painful clarity both the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>strengths and implicit weaknesses of the femi-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>nist critique of society. What is feminist prac-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>tice? What is it to be a feminist in 1976? Is it to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>be an individual woman &quot;making it&quot; in a man&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>world? Is it to recognize woman&apos;s historical
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>oppression and, released from individual frus-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>tration and guilt, to take on collective responsi-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>bility? What is the nature of such a responsibili-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>ty? Is it restricted to oneself? To oneself and the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>women one sees every week? Is this a responsi-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>bility to oneself, to women, to men, to history?
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>In short, is feminism, as an ideology, funda-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>mentally dangerous to the sexism it despises? If
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>so, how?
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l19' n='N019'/>To many women, enmeshed in the growing
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l20' n='N020'/>contradictions of late capitalist society, femi-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l21' n='N021'/>nism, by 1976, has proven as much a trap as a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l22' n='N022'/>liberation. What seemed to so many of us as
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l23' n='N023'/>little as five years ago a potentially revolution-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l24' n='N024'/>ary force now appears to be virtually co-opted.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l25' n='N025'/>The great capitalist commodity machine has
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l26' n='N026'/>produced a whole new catalogue of cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l27' n='N027'/>commodities: the feminist writer, artist, poet;
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l28' n='N028'/>the teminist academic, professional, journal-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l29' n='N029'/>ist, TV persona; the feminist token with that
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l30' n='N030'/>&quot;feminist mystique.&quot; She is for sale in the cul-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l31' n='N031'/>tural marketplace. She is tough, durable, tire-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l32' n='N032'/>ess. She is &quot;sexually liberated&quot; (a great lay). She
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l33' n='N033'/>works harder than a man. She has to. She is still
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l34' n='N034'/>a woman in a world that calls people &quot;man-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l35' n='N035'/>kind.&quot; That is, &quot;equality&quot; for women still equals
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l36' n='N036'/>inequality for women. This is a contradiction.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l37' n='N037'/>What kind of contradiction? It is a contradic-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l38' n='N038'/>tion between the ideology of bourgeois femi-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l39' n='N039'/>nism and economic and biological fact. The
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l40' n='N040'/>economic facts of life for the great majority of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l41' n='N041'/>women remain the same: unpaid domestic
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l42' n='N042'/>labor, ill-paid labor in the work force. Biological
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l43' n='N043'/>fact (which is gender difference along with its
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l44' n='N044'/>cultural baggage) proposes a contradiction,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l45' n='N045'/>even for those of us who are female tokens of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l46' n='N046'/>one sort or another, who are members of the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l47' n='N047'/>bourgeoisie.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l48' n='N048'/>Our psycho-sexual behavior, like our eco-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l49' n='N049'/>nomic roles, is wholly determined by an in-
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l50' n='N050'/>herited system of power relations, not only in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l51' n='N051'/>the public sector, but at deeper levels, in the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l52' n='N052'/>formation—within the family—of the psyche
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l53' n='N053'/>itself. Hence, as Juliet Mitchell so carefully
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>describes) it is the concept of equality which
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>is invalid within our system. The abstract ideal
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>of equality, she demonstrates, provides the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>philosophical basis for our laws. Our legal sys-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>tem, at its best, functions as if each of its in-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>dividual constituents were equal. If some
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>people have only their labor to sell, and this
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>labor produces more value than it returns to the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>laborer an unequal exchange has taken place.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>The laborer, then, and the owner of the means
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>to produce that &quot;surplus value&quot; are not equal. If
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>some people are denied, by virtue of their color,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>access even to the skills of labor, to whom are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>they equal? If half of all people have babies and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>half do not, are they all &quot;equal&quot;? Logical in-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>compatabilities arise: what is different is not the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>same, and gender (among other things) means
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>difference.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>Radical feminism has tried to take on this
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>contradiction indeed proclaimed it the essen-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>tial contradiction in our form of social organiza-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>tion. Between biology and destiny, it proposes,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>stands consciousness. Woman&apos;s oppression
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>vertically crosses class lines, crosses race lines;
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>women, armed with &quot;consciousness&quot; would
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>speak to each other across a history of divisions
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>and change the world. Women&apos;s groups would
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>not only clarify the areas of shared experience
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>which foster that consciousness, but would
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>serve as support communities. With sisterhood
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>for strength, women would hit male supremacy
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>where it lived: at home. Yet what, after all, has
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>changed? The quality of life for a few privileged
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>women —a small step. Was all that fervor, sister-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>hood and revolutionary idealism that was meant
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>to reinvent the terms for a mass movement so
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>easily engorged, packaged and recycled?
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>For radical feminism too has been partially
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>co-opted. Since it had already dropped out of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>the broader (sexist) political arena, it provided
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>support systems for women, but toward an un-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>certain end. Seeing few alternatives and tanta-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>lized by a taste of power women often used
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>that strength to re-enter the dominant culture to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>become as competitive, as &quot;good&quot; as men. Has
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>the women&apos;s movement had so little concrete
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>impact on most women&apos;s lives?
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l48' n='N048'/>Certainly the patriarchy was sufficiently
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l49' n='N049'/>threatened to let the feminist token into the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>limelight. (Why co-opt without advertising the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>co-opted product?) But she did not make it into
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>the statistics. The economic facts so far as most
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l53' n='N053'/>women are concerned remain unchanged: un-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l54' n='N054'/>paid domestic labor; ill-paid labor in the work
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l55' n='N055'/>force. The wage differential between men and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l56' n='N056'/>women in fact is now greater than it was ten
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l57' n='N057'/>years ago. Even the hard-won victory of abor-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l58' n='N058'/>tion (for a price), even the possibility of &quot;equal
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l59' n='N059'/>rights&quot; before the very laws which uphold a sys-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l60' n='N060'/>tem of inequality, are a slap in the face to an
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l61' n='N061'/>ideology which aimed to alter the very &quot;nature“
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l62' n='N062'/>of human relationships. This too is a contra-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l63' n='N063'/>diction.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>What kind of contradiction? It is a contra-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>diction between an ideology and a system; an
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>ideology which has placed its profoundly hu-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>manist hope in individual consciousness as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>somehow separable from the structures in which
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>that consciousness is created. Demystifying the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>contradictory elements of traditional feminism
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>itself, then, is part of our task. In capitalist
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>society, the process through which human labor
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>is translated into commodity, then capital, is a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>process necessarily affecting not only the pro-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>duction of tractors and bombs but the produc-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>tion of ideology. This process puts intellectual
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>labor like esthetic labor, like factory labor like
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>reproductive labor in the service of a system
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>which generates a surplus of wealth for the few
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>and subsistence for the many. This contradic-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>tion —between the forces of production (labor)
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>and the property relations of production (own-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>ership) is the contradiction which Marxists
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>claim moves history, because it produces class
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>struggle: the power of masses of people to labor
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>becomes the power to revolt.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>This contradiction has moved history. But,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>feminists ask, has it altered the basic relation
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>between woman and man, woman and child-
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>rearing, woman and psycho-sexual slavery? For
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>the hypocrisy of bourgeois ideology in relation
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>to bourgeois practice is paradigmatic within the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>structure of the family. Marriage, ostensibly a

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>was born in the 17th century along with the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>concept of equality of individuals. It was as

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>ism à la Fourier who claimed that &quot;the change
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>in historical epoch can always be determined by
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>the progress of women toward freedom.&quot;3
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>Bourgeois feminism has begun, then, in its
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>history of leaps and starts to identify and attack
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>its sexist enemy, and taken a few long strides
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>away from female feudalism for the benefit of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>some bourgeois women. But the heart of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>problem remains. Feminists from Tennessee
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>Claflin to Isadora Duncan have scored high in

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l62' n='N062'/>Monogamy asserts a situation in which one

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>per se that is in question now, but again, the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>mystification of what the individual is and can
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>control. In participating in the compromised
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>&quot;equality&quot; of marriage, each individual agrees
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>to propagate the species in the context of the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>values of patriarchy. Values are learned, sex-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>uality is formed, ideology is maintained—within
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>the family.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>When feminists claim that &quot;the personal is
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>political&quot; they refer in a sense, to this problem.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>Their hypothesis is that one can generalize from
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>the individual, internal dynamics of sexist op-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>pression, to a general rule. Freud&apos;s revelation of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>the structures of the unconscious confirms to an
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>extent the validity of that enterprise. But up to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>now feminists have not taken it far enough.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>Having accepted the existence of subconscious
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>structural analogues which mirror the differ-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>ences between the sexes in the world, we can
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>now proceed with the knowledge that, as a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>group, we are bound not only by the manifest
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>political forms of our oppression but by these
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>internal psychic monsters. In attempting to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>combat these monsters, however, feminists
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>have often mistaken the cart for the horse. The
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>personal is political—but with few exceptions,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>this invocation has simply generated a longer
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>list of symptoms of the sexist disease. We must
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>locate the causes of this disease if we are ever to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>cure it. We must exploit Freud&apos;s science of the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>mind, but only insofar as it is conjoined with
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>the science of history; that is to say out of the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>context of individualism.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>Sisterhood is really powerful only insofar as it
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>is armed with a coherent theory and a mass
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>strategy. We are in and of our culture; so is the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>feminist ideal. We must pursue, with maximum
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>scientific rigor, the vanguard theories of culture
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>which culture has produced. We must use the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>best available tools to locate the incoherence—
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>the contradictions—in extant phallocentric
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>models and generate predictive models based in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>the experience of both halves of the human
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>race. Feminists who wish to throw Freud out the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>window because of simplistic readings of &quot;penis
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>envy&quot; current in popular psychology might well
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>take a look at <hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Mitchell&apos;s Feminism and Psycho</hi>-

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l50' n='N050'/>fort there is exemplary. We cannot just look
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>back nostalgically to ancient matriarchies. In-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>deed, fantasies about matriarchy in our era are
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l53' n='N053'/>pure science fiction. But their existence does
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l54' n='N054'/>suggest that alternate models for culture can
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l55' n='N055'/>exist.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l56' n='N056'/>Recent controversy over Mitchell&apos;s book,

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l59' n='N059'/>of this issue. Interestingly, this relation of sexu-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l60' n='N060'/>ality to political economy is also being strongly
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l61' n='N061'/>developed outside a feminist context, most
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l62' n='N062'/>prominently on a major intellectual front—in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_1_1l63' n='N063'/>the tradition of French structuralism. European

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>feminists, especially in England and France,

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>ened contradictions impel them to seek out
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>means for their resolution. The main tendency
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>in this area is necessarily phallocentric: it is still
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>being written largely through the cipher of a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>male experience of the world. But if we as wom-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>en don’t begin to write ourselves into history,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>who will? For so far, compared to the scope of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>the theoretical, strategic and practical task
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>ahead, the &quot;woman question&quot; has really only
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>been given lip service by the most advanced
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>intellectual sciences —not surprising since they
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>are &quot;man-made.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>Engels, Marx and others have, of course,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>identified the monogamous, patriarchal family
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>as the central prison for woman. Mechanistic
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>Marxists therefore claim that releasing her from
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>this singular prison into the work force (under
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>socialism) must guarantee her freedom. Does it?
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>Has it?
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>Not significantly; not yet. The major 20th-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>century socialist revolutions have made some
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>progress, removing, as in China, the most bar-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>baric manifestations of sexist domination. Im-

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>Lenin&apos;s program included not only the training
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>of women to join the work force at all levels,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>but the legalization of abortion, free, accessible
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>divorce, communal daycare, etc. Within ten

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>than the building of an extra-domestic women&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>work force. In China, with the Cultural Revolu-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>tion and before, ideological struggle against the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>values of patriarchy has at least begun. But in
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>the U.S.S.R., in the context of their drive to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>quickly meet economic priorites which created
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>the bastard known as &quot;state capitalism,&quot; it was
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>easier to fall back on the ingrained behaviors of
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>the traditional family unit for free work by
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>women in the home.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>The American Communist Party reflects this
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>tendency, still defending the &quot;fighting family
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>unit&quot; as a revolutionary force—in America, a
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>reactionary notion. In fact. mothers have been
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>strong revolutionaries. The strength of the wom-

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>American imperialism is a case in point. But, as
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>in Algeria, where fighting European imperialism
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>also meant the reassertion of the heavily patri-

				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l54' n='N054'/>field and back to the kitchen. The contradic-
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l55' n='N055'/>tions of the double standard apparently are
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l56' n='N056'/>so heightened during periods of revolution that,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l57' n='N057'/>as with Bolsheviks like Alexandra Kollontai, the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l58' n='N058'/>preaching and practice of &quot;free love&quot; (and all it
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l59' n='N059'/>implies) becomes acceptable —for a brief time.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>In the U.S., too, anti-feminist backlash,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>somewhat reminiscent of the Stalinist attack on
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>women&apos;s freedom, splits American feminism
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>down its uncertain center. Though reformists
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>suggest that there is room in a liberal America
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>to heal the wounds of women, liberalism is par-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>ticularly dangerous since it cleverly masks its
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>own conservatism, its own investment in the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>status quo. Liberal ideology neatly instantiates
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>the two-part form of the contradiction. &quot;Its
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>progressive side provides a rationale for defend-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>ing the rights of individuals against the state. Its
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>reactionary side emphasized that capitalism is
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>not a system where one class exploits another
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>but is rather a collection of individuals, any
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>one of whom can succeed if he or she so
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>decides.&quot;6
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>I hope it is becoming clear how ideologically
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>messy liberalism really is from a post-humanist
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>perspective in which the individual can no
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>longer be seen as the subject of history. Liberal-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>ism is seen by leftists as a joke because it bears
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>so tenuously the wan hopes of a bankrupt hu-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>manism and is ultimately, untenable. Even
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>hard-core conservatism is more internally co-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>herent. Conservatives and Marxists alike might
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>describe capitalism as a system in which the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>&quot;stronger&quot; individuals make out. The difference,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>of course, is that conservatives say so approv-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>ingly, grounding their argument in the old dog-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>eat-dog theory of what they call human nature.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>Marxists have favored the idea that the industri-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>al capitalist system tends to pervert or alienate
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>what is potentially, or at a given historical mo-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>ment &quot;good&quot; in human beings. Stated so simply,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>both are inadequate readings but at least they
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>rehearse the consistency of these positions.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>The liberal wants to enjoy the fruits of his
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>class privilege while salving his guilty con-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>science with a quasi-philosophic posture pro-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>posing that every individual (being protected by
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>&apos;equality&apos; before the law, by ’equal&apos; opportunity
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>measures, etc.) could theoretically be enjoying
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l45' n='N045'/>this same privilege if he or she were as hard-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>working and dauntless as him/herself. Thus the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l47' n='N047'/>liberal buys off with a little charity or minimal

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l51' n='N051'/>tion. While a bill assuring equal rights before
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l52' n='N052'/>unequal laws is flung in our faces, and even
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l53' n='N053'/>defeated (adding insult to injury), the dominant
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l54' n='N054'/>media simultaneously declare the women&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_1_1l61' n='N061'/>en are the achieved &quot;equals&quot; of men. The re-

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>to change the world, all you really must do is
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>change yourself. And the mapping of contra-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>dictions comes full circle.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>The liberal feminist, like the liberal social
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>democrat, learns to sate herself on the token

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>(who, lacking a viable mass strategy, is a liberal
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>in disguise) tries to build a separatist island on
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>which she and her sisters can be &quot;free.&quot; It&apos;s a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>dilemma. I was, and in some ways still am, such
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>a radical feminist. After all, I am a member of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>the women&apos;s group which publishes this maga-

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>forms, collective practice. But what is an egali-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>tarian island in a sea of capitalist contradictions
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>but something doomed, as it were, to sinking?

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>the issues it raises for us in <hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Heresies</hi>. We are
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>constituted as a collective. Adopting one of the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>stronger aspects of feminist practice, we at-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>tempt to chip away at the hierarchical authority
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>structures of The System on a micro level by
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>attempting to produce a theoretical magazine
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>on a collective basis. The assumption here is
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>that theory and practice must develop together
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>in a dialectical relationship. But in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>function as a legal entity, we are transformed to
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/><hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Heresies</hi> Collective, Inc.; an incorporated col-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>lective. This is either redundant or ironic. The
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>fact is, we don’t even aspire to making profits
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>but are completely dependent on the legal and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>business structures around us. This dependence
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>relation, the impossibility of autonomy within a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>given economic structure, has meant about a
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>two-year life-span for most American collec-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>tives before us, according to popular lore.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>This dependence also means that artists, par-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>ticularly those artists being forced by height-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>ened economic contradictions to face political
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>realities, must re-examine their place in our
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>culture. The feminist filmmaker for example,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>has had to confront this issue head on. Film,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>more than any other artform, requires the mas-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l44' n='N044'/>tery of machine technology. For women, that
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l45' n='N045'/>technology and the authority it connotes has
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l46' n='N046'/>been historically taboo. There are exceptions in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l47' n='N047'/>the history of film 7 but the percentage of wom-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l48' n='N048'/>en filmmakers is dramatically low for a 20th-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l49' n='N049'/>century art. Feminists with the energy and sup-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l50' n='N050'/>oort of their sisters in the movement have begun
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l51' n='N051'/>to break that taboo. But in doing so, they have
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l52' n='N052'/>been thrown against a major contradiction
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l53' n='N053'/>facing all &quot;independent&quot; filmmakers: the prob-
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l54' n='N054'/>lem of capital. For to make films requires large
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l55' n='N055'/>amounts of capital, capital which is controlled
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l56' n='N056'/>by the ruling classes, middle-class liberals
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_2_1l57' n='N057'/>included.

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>tists and can hardly be answered here.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>But we can and must confront the question.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>From what is the &quot;independent&quot; filmmaker or
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>artist independent? She is not independent from
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>the need to make a living. She is not independ-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>ent from the need for capital—money which
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>gives the power to make her films and distribute
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>her films within a tight commercial media mo-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>nopoly. When a feminist wonders why capital-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>ists won’t hand over the money to make anti-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>sexist films, she, like her &quot;independent&quot; male
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>counterpart, must face the terms of her depend-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>ence. She has begun to beg, borrow or steal
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>(translated as win grants, go into debt, etc.) the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>capital to write herself into visual history, mak-
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>ing films about the experience of women; viz:
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>the films of Julia Reichert, Yvonne Rainer,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>Barbara Kopple, Chantal Ackerman, and many
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>others. But who actually sees these films? They
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>are shown in women&apos;s festivals, in avant-garde
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>and political forums in a few major cities. She
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>is, in short, caught in that same economic trap.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>Cooperatives for pooling resources and sharing
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>distribution efforts, such as New Day Films,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>are beginning to form; they are collectives like
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/><hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>Heresies</hi>. But the absolute dependence on the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>inconsistent, discrimate charity of liberals is the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>underside of that ultimately romantic hope for
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>&quot;independence.&quot; The terms for independence,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>then, among artists and feminists, are the very
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>terms of dependence. Yet another contradiction.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>I would like to convince all feminists that it is
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>time to realign with the Left. Current economic
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l43' n='N043'/>realities, heightening contradictions, and the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l44' n='N044'/>topography of world imperialism reaching its

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_1_1l46' n='N046'/>confront their need for unity. The traditionally

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>class lines <hi rend='italic:true; fontSize:0.0; kerning:0;'>and</hi> across gender lines. Within such
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>a potential configuration women could speak to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>other women. We are beginning to recognize
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>that all oppressed peoples within capitalism
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>must come together if we are even to begin to

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>and backlash of this system, much less to build
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>a new one.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>Several feminist strategies for such a realign-

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>of their own demands in relation to the needs of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>others. Women will need autonomy to develop

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>needs within a broad movement, to avoid the

				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>Thus, we must make our fight in the context of a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>movement we help to define and build, a move-
