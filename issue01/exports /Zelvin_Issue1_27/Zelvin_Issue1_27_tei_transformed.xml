         <title>Zucchini Poem</title></head>
				<p>the zucchini crouches
				behind a broad green leaf
				patient in her camouflage
				imperialist tentacles of vine
				are taking over the garden
				shouting mine mine
				like a woman waiting
				for the revolution
				the zucchini bides her time
				rain falls in the night
				first stealthy
				then triumphant like a coup d'Ã©tat
				come morning
				the zucchini squats
				swollen in the sunlight
				proud of her belly
				covering the earth
				with ayellow flower behind her ear
			</p>
         <p>Elizabeth Zelvin is a writer living in New York who has
				poems appearing in Womanspirit and 13th Moon. She has
				recently completed a book about an alternative marriage,
				and among her other interests are "singing and song-writ-
				ing, teaching creative movement, and trying to understand
				the synthesis of anarchism and feminism."
