         <p>WHATIS LEFT?
				AFTER THE BARS AND THE GATES AND THE
				DEGRADATION
				WHAT IS LEFT?
				AFTER THE LOCK INS AND THE LOCK OUTS AND THE
				LOCK UPS
				WHAT IS LEFT?
				MEAN, AFTER THE CHAINS THAT GET ENTANGLED
				INTHE GREY OF ONE'S MATTER
				AFTER THE BARS THAT GET STUCK IN THE HEARTS
				OF MEN AND WOMEN
				WHAT IS LEFT?
				AFTER THE TEARS AND DISAPPOINTMENTS
				AFTER THE LONELY ISOLATION
				AFTER THE CUT WRIST AND THE HEAVY NOOSE
				WHATIS LEFTZ
				MEAN, LIKE, AFTER THE COMMISSARY KISSES
				AND THE GET-YOUR-SHIT-OFF-BLUES
				AFTER THE HUSTLER HAS BEEN HUSTLED
				WHAT IS LEFT?
				AFTER THE SAD FUTILE MANEUVERS
				AFTER THE SHRILL AND BARREN LAUCHTER
				AFTER THE CONTRABAND EMOTIONS
				WHATIS LEFT?
				AFTER THE MURDERBURGERS AND THE COON SQUADS
				AND THE TEAR CAS
				AFTER THE BULLS AND THE BULLPENS AND THE
				BULLSHIT
				WHAT IS LEFT?
				IMEAN LIKE, AFTER YOU KNOW THAT GOD CANT BE
				TRUSTED
				AFTER YOU KNOW THAT THE SHRINK IS A PUSHER
				THAT THE WORD IS AWHIP, AND THE BADGE IS
				A BULLET
				WHAT IS LEFT?
				AFTER YOU KNOW THAT THE DEAD ARE STILL
				WALKING
				AFTER YOU REALIZE THAT SILENCE IS TALKING
				THAT OUTSIDE AND INSIDE ARE JUST AN ILLUSION
				WHAT IS LEFT?
				MEAN, LIKE, WHERE IS THE SUN?
				WHERE ARE HER ARMS AND WHERE ARE HER KISSES?
				THERE ARE LIP PRINTS ON MY PILLOW
				IAM SEARCHING
				WHAT IS LEFT?
				IMEAN, LIKE, NOTHING IS STANDSTILL AND
				NOTHING IS ABSTRACT
				THE WING OF A BUTTERFLY CANT TAKE FLICHT
				THE FOOTON MY NECK IS APART OF A BODY
				THE SONGTHATISING'IS APART OF AN ECHO
				WHAT IS LEFT?
				MEAN, LIKE, LOVE IS SPECIFIC
				IS MY MIND A MACHINE GUN?
				IS MY HEART AHACKSAW?
				CANI MAKE FREEDOM REAL? YEAH,
				WHAT IS LEFT?
				AMATTHE TOP AND BOTTOM OF A LOWER-ARCHY
				AM IN LOVE WITH LOSERS AND LAUCHTER
				IAM IN LOVE WITH FREEDOM AND CHILDREN
				LOVE IS MYSWORD AND TRUTH IS MY COMPASS
				WHAT IS LEFT?
