         <p>watch out! you may meet a real
				castrating female
				or
				you'Il say I'm a manhating braburning
				lesbian member of the castration
				penisenvy brigade, which I am
				I would like to speak.
				I would like to give a tubthumpingtablebanging
				emotional rap AND be listened to, not laughed at.
				You don’t laugh at what your comrade brothers
				say, you wouldn’t laugh at the negroes, the black
				panthers. Many women are beginning to feel the
				necessity to speak for themselves, for their sisters.
				I feel the necessity now.
				It's the moratorium. l would say, oh yes, the war is
				bad a pig bosses war may the nlf win, I also say
				VICTORY TO THE VIETNAMESE WOMEN. Now
				our brothers on the left in the peace movement
				will think that what I am about to say is not justi¬
				fied, this is a moratorium. It's justified anywhere.
				We've heard you loud and clear before, brother¬
				shits, we know we have to work towards the Revo¬
				lution and then join the ladies liberation auxiliary
				if we have any time left over. l've worked my
				priorities out, I will work towards what I know
				about, what I feel, and I feel because l'm told ad
				infinitum that l'm a woman, l'm a second-class
				citizen, and l should shutup right now because my
				mind's between my legs. I say you think with your
				pricks. We should all get our priorities straight and
				organise around our own injustices, our own con¬
				dition. There are a lot of people here who feel
				strongly about the Vietnam war. But how many of
				you, who can see so clearly the suffering and
				misery in Vietnam, how many of you can see at
				the end of your piggy noses the women who can't
				get abortions, how many of you would get off your
				fat piggy asses and protest against the killing and
				victimisation of women in your own country. Go
				check the figures, how many Australian men have
				died in Vietnam, and how many women have died
				from backyard abortions. Yes, that's cool, they're
				only women, and you'Il perhaps worry if your own
				chickie gets pregnant. Can you think about all the
				unwanted children, or the discrimination against
				unmarried mothers. Illegal dangerous abortions
				are going to be performed regardless. So make
				them legal. And to these women who think an
				abortion campaign, or women's lib for that matter,
				is reformist, I quote "in fighting for our liberation
				we will not ask what is revolutionary or reformist,
				only what is good for women" some of us are rev¬
				olutionaries, some of us are manhunting crazies,
				but we are all working toward one thing, the lib¬
				eration of women, and most of us will recognise
				that this will only happen in a socialist society.
				We all feel very strongly about conscription and
				freedom of the individual, some go to great lengths
				to martyr themselves on the issue of the draft. I
				don’t feel very strongly anymore about the ego
				scenes of the mike jones's around me. I do feel
				strongly about my freedom and my sisters' free¬
				dom. Women are conscripted every day into their
				personalised slave kitchens, can you, with your
				mind filled with the moratorium, spare a thought
				for their freedom, identity, minds and emotions,
				they're women, and your stomach is full. It suits
				you to keep women in the kitchens, and underpaid
				menial jobs, and with the children. You, by your
			</p>
         <p>silence, apathy and laughter sanction the legis¬
				lators, the pig parliamentarians, the same men
				who sanction the war in Vietnam. You won’t make
				an issue of abortion, equal pay, and child minding
				centres, because they're women's matters, and
				under your veneer you are brothers to the pig
				politicians. And I say to all you highminded
				intellectual women who say you're liberated with
				such force and conviction, I say you make me
				sick. So women's lib doesn’t concern you. Ask your
				companion what he would prefer—to talk to you
				or fuck you? (and if you say you'd prefer to be
				fucked, you've absorbed your conditioning well).
				And the women in the suburbs are no concern of
				yours? Your mother is no concern of yours? so long
				as you think you're liberated, all's well. You and
				your sisters and the silent suburban women are all
				part of a capitalist PATRIARCHAL society which
				you cannot ignore.
				And don’t start to trust the sympathetic men who
				want a socialist society. Where will the women be
				after the revolution? Go, ask them, the men on the
				left stink—they stink from their motherfucking
				socks to their long hair, from their jock straps to
				their mao and moratorium badges. The ones who
				pretend to espouse our aims are far worse than
				those who at least wear their true colors on their
				sleeves. And to my brothers on the drug scene.
				Grass is good. Oh yes, but instead of becoming
				happy and peaceful and oh so motherfucking lov¬
				ing all I can see is you sitting there, asserting, even
				grooving on your maleness, dominating every joint
				every puff. Chickies aren’t very good at rapping,
				aren’t clever or subtle enough. I mean, it's a male
				scene, isn’t it, you fat arrogant farts.
				Okay, I've stopped trying to love and understand
				my oppressors.
				I know who my enemy is.
				I will tell you what I feel, as an individual, as a
				woman.
				I feel that there can be no love between men and
				women.
				Maybe after the revolution people will be able to
				love each other regardless of skin color, ethnic
				origin, occupation or type of genitals. But if that
				happens it will only happen if we make it happen.
				Starting right now.
				I feel hatred.
				I feel anger.
				Without indulging in an equality or marxist argu¬
				ment I say all power to women because that's what
				I feel.
				ALL POWER.
				And I say to every woman that every time you're
				put down or fucked over, every time they kick you
				cunningly in the teeth, go stand on the street
				corner and tell every man that walks by, every one
				of them a male chauvinist by virtue of HIS birth¬
				right, tell them all to go suck their own cocks. And
				when they laugh, tell them that they're getting
				bloody defensive, and that you know what size
				weapon to buy to kill the bodies that you've un¬
				fortunately laid under often enough.
				ALL POWER TO WOMEN.
				"Kate Jennings is a feminist. She believes in what Jane
				Austen recommended at fifteen: Run mad as often as you
				chuse; but do not faint.'" This "biography" appears on the
				jacket of Jennings' book of poems (from which "Moratori¬
				um" is reprinted)—Come to Me My Melancholy Baby.
				published in 1975 by Outback Press, Fitzroy (Victoria), in
				her native Australia.
