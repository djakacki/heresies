				who include among their skills <note>Nil</note>video, painting, sculpture, drawing,
				and <note>Martine</note>poetry; and among their nationalities French, Turkish, Canadian,
				American. This work on <note>prison</note><orgName key="La Roquette Prisons" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q736641">La Roquette</orgName> began when Judy and Mimi met
				through their children at a <placeName key="day care" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q364005">day-care center</placeName>. Judy mentioned her
				collaboration with Nil on the theme of living conditions in each of
				<placeName><placeName>Paris' <placeName>20 arrondissements</placeName></placeName></placeName>, for which the <placeName key="prison" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q40357">prison</placeName> had been suggested to
				represent the 11th <note>administrative district</note>arrondissement. Mimi, it turned out, had been
				detained there, and she offered an elaboration of her experiences.
				Martine, whose writing is based on her own memories and dreams,
				also joined the project, while Nil offered her use of video to universalize the narrative elements, in collaboration with Nicole, who
				concentrated on the esthetic/sociological aspects of the research.
				The result is a visual representation of the prison and of the personal
				experiences of many women, centered around the group's increasing
				consciousness of the meaning of <note>narrative with videotape, and images</note>Mimi's story: "Bonds of friendship,
				constantly confirmed, played the most cohesive role on the level of
				the work itself, resulting in the combination of apparently disparate
				means connected to each other by mutual understanding within the
				group." The following narrative accompanies a videotape from which
				most of the images are taken.
         <p>The other women were mostly in the prison for bad checks,
				prostitution, or, like me, for robbery. There were also some murderers; I knew one in my workshop. Another had been accused of stealing a painting. The first days we asked each other, but afterwards we
				didn’t really say "What are you doing here?" except to our best
				friends. </p>
			<p>	These women came from all classes. In general, relations be tween inmates were pretty good. There were a lot of lesbians; the<note>controlled the prison</note>
				<persName key="Nuns" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q58141325">nuns</persName>' attitudes toward them was to turn a blind eye. They couldn't
				not have known about it. The girls hid it a little—and even a lot—but
				it was too obvious. As for me, I was not a lesbian, but I nevertheless
				flirted here and there to pass the time. It could have certain advan¬
				tages: when you didn’t have any money, your friends could buy
				things at the <note>prison store</note><placeName>canteen</placeName> for you. Or, at one time, I went out with an
				English girl who was the favorite of a nun who didn’t like me, and
				from that day on, that nun was very nice to me, and I got certain
				favors I shouldn’t have had. </p>
				<p> But still there were lots of fights, sometimes for no reason at all,
        just because the girls felt like fighting. Sometimes it was a question of
				class. Some girls felt superior to others: it wasn’t a question of
				money, but of intellect. ... So sometimes one girl would insult
				another, or feel insulted, and there would be a fight. We were a
				whole gang; some had to be in charge. And if you knew how to fight,
				you were respected. There was nothing you could do about it.</p>
			<p>	Sometimes fights started over cigarettes. For example, I got into
				a fight with a girl over that. Every Wednesday we had the right to buy
				four packs of cigarettes at the canteen. This girl didn’t smoke, so,
				with my money, I had bought her something she needed, and she,
				with her money, was going to buy me four more packs, which would
				have made eight for the week. She bought me the cigarettes, but
				another girl told her to give them to her. She was very weak and she
				didn’t dare refuse. That night I waited for her in her cell and I beat her
				up. The week after that she bought me cigarettes, and she didn’t even
				ask me for money. Afterwards—it's stupid, she was a coward—she
				would pick up butts in the yard for me, when I really didn’t expect
				that from her. When the other girls saw that, they all turned against
				her. When I saw that, I stood up for her, because I don’t like to take
				sides. l'd hit her a little, but I didn’t have a grudge against her.</p>
      	<p> Another time there was a fight in the mess hall, in front of the
				nun. There was blood on the floor: one girl had had a nosebleed, and
				the other had been hurt elsewhere. I was drawing; with my finger
				picked up some drops of blood and put them on my drawing. </p>
				<p> But there was also a feeling of solidarity among the inmates. One
				time, for example, a girl had been punished and locked up in the
				<placeName key="Mess Hall" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q99460745">mess hall</placeName> toilets. I didn’t know what she had done, I don’t even know
				if she had really done anything; in any case it was totally unjust to
				lock her up like that. So, with my friend, I climbed onto the ledge
				over the mess hall door and we said that we would stay there until
				they let this girl out. Normally we should have done two weeks in the
				cooler for that, but we didn’t get anything. We would have done it
				anyway because it was unjust.
				Or one day a girl gave me a little piece of candle about two
				inches long. We were forbidden to have candles, but there were a lot
				of things like that that went around the prison. I don’t know how she
				got it; that was the sort of question you didn’t ask. She gave it to me
				because she knew that I liked to read.
				We also managed to pass notes from cell to cell by what we
				called the <note>system the inmates used to communicate with each other</note>"yoyo" system. You tied the note to a piece of string and
				you put it through the window. We did that for certain girls who were
				in the cooler<note>form of punishment</note> when we were in the yard. We would send them a note
			</p>
         <pb n="3"/>
         <p>from their best friends or something like that.
				As for the nuns, apart from some who were especially mean,
				they were mostly indifferent. But they had, of course, their favorites.
				It was a question of personality: they liked the docile inmates. In the
				beginning they didn’t like me because I was stubborn and rude to
				them. Afterwards, I sometimes behaved better. But in any case,
				being with the English girl, I could do things that were forbidden and
				not get punished. Sometimes, for example, I would go into the yard
				to pick up butts that the richer girls had left; we weren’t allowed to do
				that other than at recess. Or I tried doing all kinds of things so I could
				go to the cooler, because l had a friend who sang in church and in the
				cooler there was a lot of echo. But despite all I did I never got sent,
				while some girls did nothing at all and got sent right away.
				Down in the cooler you were isolated from everybody. You got
				no mail or visits. You never left your cell, except once a day when
				you had a walk, alone, in the yard. You only had one meal a day
				which was brought to you in your cell.
				Generally speaking, it took a certain amount of time to make
				friends. I didn’t have this problem because there were already two
				people there whom I knew when I arrived. But for the others who had
				no soap, no handkerchiefs (the prison gave you nothing, not even
			</p>
         <p>sanitary napkins; all they gave me when I came in was a rag to wash
				myself with), if they weren’t resourceful, if they didn’t get some
				friends to help them, they couldn’t make it. You had to work about
				ten days before having enough money to buy things at the canteen.
				The money that you made working, making key rings, was only
				just enough to buy cigarettes. You were paid 80 centimes (15 cents)
				for one hundred key rings, about a day’s work. Those who worked
				really fast managed to make two hundred. I started working the
				second day after my arrival, but I lost the tool I had been given. I got
				yelled at by the nun, and I saw that it was badly paid, so I stopped.
				Instead, I spent my days reading. I could do this because I was not
				sentenced yet, while those who were had to work. The catalogue
				from the library was passed in the workshop and we had the right to
				two books a week; I would ask some girls who didn’t read to order
				some for me. I read everything—<persName key="Pearl S. Buck" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q80900">Pearl Buck</persName>, books on explorations.
				also spent a lot of time drawing, and sometimes I would go out. My
				seat was at the end of the workshop, near the door, so it was easy for
				me to go out in the yard when the nun wasn’t looking.
				The money that you had on you on entering the prison was kept;
				you could only use it in the canteen. Some inmates received money
				orders; many of them, actually, got money. As for me, my brother
			</p>
         <pb n="4"/>
         <p>sent me a hundred francs (20 dollars) and a little money that I had left
				in a book at my mother's. But for those who had no money at all, the
				only way to get any was to work.
				At the canteen you could buy pencils, letter paper, envelopes,
				toilet articles, or wool. Some knitted; it was winter and it was neces¬
				sary if you didn’t have any clothes. You could also buy french fries,
				puddings and prepared dishes that you could have on Sundays. We
				couldn’t have newspapers, but we could buy magazines like Jours de
				France.
				About these magazines—we bought them for the recipes that
				were in them. Often there were pictures with the recipe, so we would
				tear them from the magazine and eat them. For example, if you liked
				salad, you would eat pictures of salad. We also ate pictures of
				chicken, cakes, or things like that.
				At the meals we got mostly starchy food—potatoes, beans, or
				cauliflower; there was also bread. They gave us meat, but it was very
				tough. In fact we couldn’t cut it with the blunt children's knives that
				we bought at the canteen. We ate it with our hands, tearing it with
				our teeth. At the end of the meal—which had been served by in¬
				mates—we did our own dishes. We had brought our bowls and our
				cutlery to the mess hall in the cardboard boxes that we took every¬
			</p>
         <p>where with us, and we went in little groups to wash them with cold
				water. To wipe them, l used the rag they had given me when I came
				in...
				About twice a week we could bring back up to the cells the rice
				pudding we had had for dessert at supper. I loved this and often ex¬
				changed two cigarettes for a bowl. We went up two by two, and
				silently. If we talked, the nun made us stop until we were silent again.
				Between the time we went up and the time we went to bed there was
				about half an hour, when we had the right to stay near the stove and
				toast pieces of bread. We talked, or we sang; l'had a friend who sang
				very well, and we gathered around her. She sang some of Adamo's
				songs, but also some she had written herself, like one about the nuns
				to the tune of Morpionibus. She also sang in church; she had spent
				years in a religious boarding school and she knew the whole mass in
				Latin. ... It was forbidden to sing in the cells once the doors were
				closed, but we did it anyway. We all sang together. The nuns couldn’t
				put us all in <placeName>the cooler</placeName>; they contented themselves with yelling into
				the void.
				On our beds we had the right to three blankets—and no more—
				and two sheets. In summer it might be enough, but in December
				found another blanket when one of the girls in my cell left, but it was

         <p>taken away in a search. The heat was provided by a stove in the hall;
				there was one stove for forty cells. One girl in my cell had accumu¬
				lated several cardboard boxes; for a while she used them as storage
				space. Then one night when all the doors had been locked and the
				lights turned out, she set fire to her boxes to get warm. A nun realized
				this and came to ask what was going on. We both pretended to sleep,
				but in the end I lifted my head and told the nun that I didn’t know
				anything, that I hadn’t seen anything, and that I couldn’t tell her
				anything else.
				It wouldn’t stick: I was all alone with the other girl and I was
				saying that I hadn’t seen anything. The next day the girl I was friends
				with said that I couldn’t have done it. She knew me and she knew that
				didn’t have bizarre ideas like that. The other girl did two weeks in
				the cooler, but I could have gone too because I hadn’t said any¬
				thing.
				Every week there was a shower session. It was in cubicles that
				didn’t close, and there were three of us in each cubicle. The water ran
				sometimes too hot, sometimes too cold. When it stopped, everyone
				had to be through, and even if your head was full of soap, there was
				nothing you could do about it. You had to find a way to rinse yourself
				with cold water afterwards; sometimes when you finally got a chance
				to do it, your head was already half dry.
				As for clothes, pants were forbidden. Men were banished from
				our environment and the nuns would say "Stop wriggling!" when we
				saw workers from <placeName key="Fresnes Prison" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q5503154">Fresnes</placeName> (men’s prison). We weren’t supposed to
				look at them. We had to wear dresses or skirts. When I arrived, I was
				wearing pants, so to replace it they gave me a burlap dress. In the
				beginning I didn’t have any other clothes; I wore it night and day.
				couldn’t wash it and until I got other clothes, my dress stayed
				dirty.... One girl had made herself a skirt from a blanket, so she
				went to the cooler. It was a beautiful skirt and it was a long time
				before they realized what she had done. I don’t know where she
				found the needle and thread; they were among the things that circu¬
				lated. ... The sheets and rags which had been given to us were
				washed in the linen room. The linen maids, like those who served the
				meals, were inmates who had been there a long time and who had
				won the trust of the nuns. The sheets were changed about once a
				month; it was far from ideal when there were lice.
				During my stay there was an epidemic of lice. The nuns told us
				to go to the kitchen and ask for vinegar, and we put it on our heads.
				When it was dry we put on some powder, and then a scarf; we stayed
				like that for three days. If you had lice it was considered bad and no
				one approached you any more. One of the nuns made fun of me; she
			</p>
         <p>said, "If you washed every day. " or something like that. I told her
				that she had surely had them before me. It was the first time in my
				life that I had them, so.
				The cells were searched pretty often, sometimes when we were
				there, but mostly during the day when we were in the workshop. The
				nuns looked for knives and candles we had gotten by exchange, or
				other things we weren’t allowed to have. They also looked for mail
				between inmates; we had the right to write letters to each other, but
				not love letters. Once one of the nuns—a young one who must have
				been under thirty—wrote to one of my friends. She told her that she
				liked her and that she would like to have a closer relationship with
				her. The letter was found and the nun in question was expelled. This
				sort of thing happened from time to time.
				Everything we received from the outside was also searched. We
				received our packages all cut up and opened. All our letters were
				read, those that we got as well as those we sent. Some had practically
				nothing in them, but they couldn’t go through because they were too
				long. People wrote to us with the smallest writing possible because
				one page, written very small, went through, but 2 pages, written in
				large letters, didn’t. As for the letters that we wrote, everything
				concerning prison life, the nuns, or what we ate, was censored. We
				could talk about the books we had read, and a minimum about what
				we did, but that was all. In general, what went through or not
				depended on the person who read the mail. Some letters that
				shouldn’t have gone through went anyway, and vice versa.
				We were also searched when we left the prison. You couldn’t
				take out anything that might be a souvenir. One of my friends, for
				example, had made a drawing of a little girl taking water in her hand
				to offer a doe; they didn’t let her take her drawing out. In these
				searches you couldn’t really hide anything, and what was least likely
				to be found was what wasn’t hidden. In the end they looked more
				often into the girls' vaginas to see if they had hidden letters than in
				the luggage. As for me, I had certain drawings and papers which
				normally I wouldn’t have been allowed to take out. I just left them
				with my things and they weren’t even seen.
				It was on the eve of my departure that they told me that I was
				coming out. Until then I had no idea how long they were going to
				keep me. I could have gone out on probation before, but only on
				condition that they tell my mother. I preferred that they didn’t. Once
				out, I didn’t have the right to write to my inmate friends who stayed.
				Sundays were different from other days. In the morning, some
				went to church and the others stayed locked up in their cells, but we
				could go into our friends' cells. Afterwards we did the cleaning up

         <p>That day we didn’t work, and we could sit where we liked in the
				workshop-mess hall. The nuns put the radio on, but they turned it off
				as soon as the news came on. They didn’t let us know what was going
				on in the outside world. To pass the time we played games. For
				instance, we played truth games. We asked questions about incidents
				that had happened a few days before and about which we hadn’t
				managed to find out the truth. The girls were generally honest; you
				couldn’t lie in that game, otherwise you didn’t play. But the biggest
				pastime was cards—Tarot, Belote. Some of them were played with
				real cards that some girls had managed to smuggle in. The others had
				been made with empty packs of Gitanes on which we had drawn.
				Some girls tattooed themselves. They would take ink from ball
				point pens and mix it with cigarette ash. This way they managed to
				make an ink which was pretty indelible—blue-black. Then they took
				two needles, one projecting in front of the other, and put a drop of
				ink between them. Then, with the projecting needle they made the
				drop slip into the hole. This made a point; they made as many points
				as they wanted. They made snakes, hearts, names, but mostly just
				three points, which means "Death to the Pigs," or five points¬
				"Alone Between Four Walls." It was the emblem of prison.
				We wrote all over ourselves with pens, and there were ways of
				making up your face. With ashes from the stove in the hall and water
				we could make mascara. There were black felt pens that we could use
				as eyeliner, but it was hard to take off and we usually did it with shoe
				polish that we got at the canteen. We mostly made our eyes up, but
				some girls put brown pencil around their lips.
				Some girls reacted badly to prison lite, but we tried to help them,
				and they managed to make friends, to find people who helped them overcome their distress. I wouldn’t leave a poor girl by herself who
				arrived here and who looked completely lost. I went to see her,
				talked to her. Of course there were those who had their husbands and
				their children outside; for them it was harder. I was told that once a
				girl hanged herself. Sometimes there were also attempts at escape;
				was told that one inmate hid herself in a garbage can, but she didn’t
				have time to get out and was killed inside the garbage truck.
				At Christmas <orgName key="The Salvation Army" ref="http://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q188307">the Salvation Arm</orgName>y came. We got together in the
				mess hall and listened to them sing Christmas carols. These women
				were very nice. They gave each of us a towel, a handkerchief, and a
				pack of candy. We had a lot of fun because we weren’t used to seeing
				this sort of woman. Everybody was laughing, but they were well
				received by the inmates. In the end we thought it was really nice of
				them to trouble themselves for us. I think a lot of the girls were
				touched.
				For the meal, we put all the tables together to be the most
				together possible. Those who had saved a little money bought pas¬
				tries, but almost everything was shared. I, for example, didn’t have
				any money, but I had a little of everything like everybody else. On
				the part of the prison, there was nothing, except that we didn’t work
				that day and we could go to midnight mass. A lot of people were
				depressed that day; all this reminded us of our families and of all the
				things we were trying to forget. It was nice, this party, but actually it
				was painful. The monotony of the other days was better. We didn’t
				really give each other presents. We didn’t have the possibility of
				giving anything, except cigarettes. The girl I was going out with gave
				me some cigarettes.</p>
