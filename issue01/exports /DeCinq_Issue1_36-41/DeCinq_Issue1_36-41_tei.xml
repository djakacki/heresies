				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N002'/>Groupe de Cinq
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>The Group of Five is a Paris-based collective consisting of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>Martine Aballea, Judy Blum, Nicole Croiset, Mimi, and Nil Yalter,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>who include among their skills video, painting, sculpture, drawing,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>and poetry; and among their nationalities French, Turkish, Canadian,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>American. This work on La Roquette began when Judy and Mimi met
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>through their children at a day-care center. Judy mentioned her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>collaboration with Nil on the theme of living conditions in each of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>Paris&apos; 20 arrondissements, for which the prison had been suggested to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>represent the 11th arrondissement. Mimi, it turned out, had been
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>detained there, and she offered an elaboration of her experiences.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>Martine, whose writing is based on her own memories and dreams,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>also joined the project, while Nil offered her use of video to univer¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>salize the narrative elements, in collaboration with Nicole, who
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>concentrated on the esthetic/sociological aspects of the research.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>The result is a visual representation of the prison and of the personal
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>experiences of many women, centered around the group&apos;s increasing
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>consciousness of the meaning of Mimi&apos;s story: &quot;Bonds of friendship,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>constantly confirmed, played the most cohesive role on the level of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>the work itself, resulting in the combination of apparently disparate
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>means connected to each other by mutual understanding within the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>group.&quot; The following narrative accompanies a videotape from which
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>most of the images are taken.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>The other women were mostly in the prison for bad checks,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>prostitution, or, like me, for robbery. There were also some murder¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>ers; I knew one in my workshop. Another had been accused of steal¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>ing a painting. The first days we asked each other, but afterwards we
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>didn’t really say &quot;What are you doing here?&quot; except to our best
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l6' n='N006'/>friends.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l7' n='N007'/>These women came from all classes. In general, relations be¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l8' n='N008'/>tween inmates were pretty good. There were a lot of lesbians; the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l9' n='N009'/>nuns&apos; attitudes toward them was to turn a blind eye. They couldn&apos;t
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l10' n='N010'/>not have known about it. The girls hid it a little—and even a lot—but
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l11' n='N011'/>it was too obvious. As for me, I was not a lesbian, but I nevertheless
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l12' n='N012'/>flirted here and there to pass the time. It could have certain advan¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l13' n='N013'/>tages: when you didn’t have any money, your friends could buy
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l14' n='N014'/>things at the canteen for you. Or, at one time, I went out with an
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l15' n='N015'/>English girl who was the favorite of a nun who didn’t like me, and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l16' n='N016'/>from that day on, that nun was very nice to me, and I got certain
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l17' n='N017'/>favors I shouldn’t have had.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l18' n='N018'/>But still there were lots of fights, sometimes for no reason at all,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>just because the girls felt like fighting. Sometimes it was a question of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>class. Some girls felt superior to others: it wasn’t a question of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>money, but of intellect. ... So sometimes one girl would insult
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>another, or feel insulted, and there would be a fight. We were a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>whole gang; some had to be in charge. And if you knew how to fight,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>you were respected. There was nothing you could do about it.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>Sometimes fights started over cigarettes. For example, I got into
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>a fight with a girl over that. Every Wednesday we had the right to buy
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>four packs of cigarettes at the canteen. This girl didn’t smoke, so,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>with my money, I had bought her something she needed, and she,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>with her money, was going to buy me four more packs, which would
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>have made eight for the week. She bought me the cigarettes, but
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>another girl told her to give them to her. She was very weak and she
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>didn’t dare refuse. That night I waited for her in her cell and I beat her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>up. The week after that she bought me cigarettes, and she didn’t even
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>ask me for money. Afterwards—it&apos;s stupid, she was a coward—she
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>would pick up butts in the yard for me, when I really didn’t expect
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>that from her. When the other girls saw that, they all turned against
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>her. When I saw that, I stood up for her, because I don’t like to take
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>sides. l&apos;d hit her a little, but I didn’t have a grudge against her.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>Another time there was a fight in the mess hall, in front of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>nun. There was blood on the floor: one girl had had a nosebleed, and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>the other had been hurt elsewhere. I was drawing; with my finger
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>picked up some drops of blood and put them on my drawing.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>But there was also a feeling of solidarity among the inmates. One
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>time, for example, a girl had been punished and locked up in the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>mess hall toilets. I didn’t know what she had done, I don’t even know
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>if she had really done anything; in any case it was totally unjust to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>lock her up like that. So, with my friend, I climbed onto the ledge
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>over the mess hall door and we said that we would stay there until
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>they let this girl out. Normally we should have done two weeks in the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>cooler for that, but we didn’t get anything. We would have done it
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>anyway because it was unjust.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>Or one day a girl gave me a little piece of candle about two
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>inches long. We were forbidden to have candles, but there were a lot
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>of things like that that went around the prison. I don’t know how she
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>got it; that was the sort of question you didn’t ask. She gave it to me
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>because she knew that I liked to read.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>We also managed to pass notes from cell to cell by what we
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l40' n='N040'/>called the &quot;yoyo&quot; system. You tied the note to a piece of string and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l41' n='N041'/>you put it through the window. We did that for certain girls who were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l42' n='N042'/>in the cooler when we were in the yard. We would send them a note
			</p>
			<pb n='3'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>from their best friends or something like that.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>As for the nuns, apart from some who were especially mean,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>they were mostly indifferent. But they had, of course, their favorites.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>It was a question of personality: they liked the docile inmates. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>beginning they didn’t like me because I was stubborn and rude to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>them. Afterwards, I sometimes behaved better. But in any case,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>being with the English girl, I could do things that were forbidden and
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>not get punished. Sometimes, for example, I would go into the yard
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>to pick up butts that the richer girls had left; we weren’t allowed to do
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>that other than at recess. Or I tried doing all kinds of things so I could
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>go to the cooler, because l had a friend who sang in church and in the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>cooler there was a lot of echo. But despite all I did I never got sent,
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>while some girls did nothing at all and got sent right away.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>Down in the cooler you were isolated from everybody. You got
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>no mail or visits. You never left your cell, except once a day when
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>you had a walk, alone, in the yard. You only had one meal a day
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>which was brought to you in your cell.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>Generally speaking, it took a certain amount of time to make
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>friends. I didn’t have this problem because there were already two
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>people there whom I knew when I arrived. But for the others who had
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>no soap, no handkerchiefs (the prison gave you nothing, not even
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>sanitary napkins; all they gave me when I came in was a rag to wash
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>myself with), if they weren’t resourceful, if they didn’t get some
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>friends to help them, they couldn’t make it. You had to work about
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>ten days before having enough money to buy things at the canteen.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>The money that you made working, making key rings, was only
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>just enough to buy cigarettes. You were paid 80 centimes (15 cents)
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>for one hundred key rings, about a day’s work. Those who worked
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>really fast managed to make two hundred. I started working the
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>second day after my arrival, but I lost the tool I had been given. I got
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>yelled at by the nun, and I saw that it was badly paid, so I stopped.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>Instead, I spent my days reading. I could do this because I was not
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>sentenced yet, while those who were had to work. The catalogue
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>from the library was passed in the workshop and we had the right to
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>two books a week; I would ask some girls who didn’t read to order
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>some for me. I read everything—Pearl Buck, books on explorations.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>also spent a lot of time drawing, and sometimes I would go out. My
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>seat was at the end of the workshop, near the door, so it was easy for
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>me to go out in the yard when the nun wasn’t looking.
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>The money that you had on you on entering the prison was kept;
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>you could only use it in the canteen. Some inmates received money
				<lb facs='#facs_3_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>orders; many of them, actually, got money. As for me, my brother
			</p>
			<pb n='4'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>sent me a hundred francs (20 dollars) and a little money that I had left
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>in a book at my mother&apos;s. But for those who had no money at all, the
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>only way to get any was to work.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>At the canteen you could buy pencils, letter paper, envelopes,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>toilet articles, or wool. Some knitted; it was winter and it was neces¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>sary if you didn’t have any clothes. You could also buy french fries,
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>puddings and prepared dishes that you could have on Sundays. We
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>couldn’t have newspapers, but we could buy magazines like Jours de
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>France.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>About these magazines—we bought them for the recipes that
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>were in them. Often there were pictures with the recipe, so we would
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>tear them from the magazine and eat them. For example, if you liked
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>salad, you would eat pictures of salad. We also ate pictures of
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>chicken, cakes, or things like that.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>At the meals we got mostly starchy food—potatoes, beans, or
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>cauliflower; there was also bread. They gave us meat, but it was very
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>tough. In fact we couldn’t cut it with the blunt children&apos;s knives that
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>we bought at the canteen. We ate it with our hands, tearing it with
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>our teeth. At the end of the meal—which had been served by in¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>mates—we did our own dishes. We had brought our bowls and our
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>cutlery to the mess hall in the cardboard boxes that we took every¬
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l1' n='N001'/>where with us, and we went in little groups to wash them with cold
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l2' n='N002'/>water. To wipe them, l used the rag they had given me when I came
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l3' n='N003'/>in...
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l4' n='N004'/>About twice a week we could bring back up to the cells the rice
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l5' n='N005'/>pudding we had had for dessert at supper. I loved this and often ex¬
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l6' n='N006'/>changed two cigarettes for a bowl. We went up two by two, and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l7' n='N007'/>silently. If we talked, the nun made us stop until we were silent again.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l8' n='N008'/>Between the time we went up and the time we went to bed there was
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l9' n='N009'/>about half an hour, when we had the right to stay near the stove and
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l10' n='N010'/>toast pieces of bread. We talked, or we sang; l&apos;had a friend who sang
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l11' n='N011'/>very well, and we gathered around her. She sang some of Adamo&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l12' n='N012'/>songs, but also some she had written herself, like one about the nuns
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l13' n='N013'/>to the tune of Morpionibus. She also sang in church; she had spent
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l14' n='N014'/>years in a religious boarding school and she knew the whole mass in
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l15' n='N015'/>Latin. ... It was forbidden to sing in the cells once the doors were
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l16' n='N016'/>closed, but we did it anyway. We all sang together. The nuns couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l17' n='N017'/>put us all in the cooler; they contented themselves with yelling into
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l18' n='N018'/>the void.
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l19' n='N019'/>On our beds we had the right to three blankets—and no more—
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l20' n='N020'/>and two sheets. In summer it might be enough, but in December
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_7_1l21' n='N021'/>found another blanket when one of the girls in my cell left, but it was
			</p>
			<pb n='5'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>taken away in a search. The heat was provided by a stove in the hall;
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>there was one stove for forty cells. One girl in my cell had accumu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>lated several cardboard boxes; for a while she used them as storage
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>space. Then one night when all the doors had been locked and the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>lights turned out, she set fire to her boxes to get warm. A nun realized
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>this and came to ask what was going on. We both pretended to sleep,
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>but in the end I lifted my head and told the nun that I didn’t know
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>anything, that I hadn’t seen anything, and that I couldn’t tell her
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>anything else.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>It wouldn’t stick: I was all alone with the other girl and I was
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>saying that I hadn’t seen anything. The next day the girl I was friends
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>with said that I couldn’t have done it. She knew me and she knew that
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>didn’t have bizarre ideas like that. The other girl did two weeks in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>the cooler, but I could have gone too because I hadn’t said any¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>thing.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>Every week there was a shower session. It was in cubicles that
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>didn’t close, and there were three of us in each cubicle. The water ran
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>sometimes too hot, sometimes too cold. When it stopped, everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>had to be through, and even if your head was full of soap, there was
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>nothing you could do about it. You had to find a way to rinse yourself
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>with cold water afterwards; sometimes when you finally got a chance
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>to do it, your head was already half dry.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>As for clothes, pants were forbidden. Men were banished from
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>our environment and the nuns would say &quot;Stop wriggling!&quot; when we
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>saw workers from Fresnes (men’s prison). We weren’t supposed to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>look at them. We had to wear dresses or skirts. When I arrived, I was
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>wearing pants, so to replace it they gave me a burlap dress. In the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>beginning I didn’t have any other clothes; I wore it night and day.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l29' n='N029'/>couldn’t wash it and until I got other clothes, my dress stayed
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l30' n='N030'/>dirty.... One girl had made herself a skirt from a blanket, so she
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l31' n='N031'/>went to the cooler. It was a beautiful skirt and it was a long time
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l32' n='N032'/>before they realized what she had done. I don’t know where she
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l33' n='N033'/>found the needle and thread; they were among the things that circu¬
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l34' n='N034'/>lated. ... The sheets and rags which had been given to us were
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l35' n='N035'/>washed in the linen room. The linen maids, like those who served the
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l36' n='N036'/>meals, were inmates who had been there a long time and who had
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l37' n='N037'/>won the trust of the nuns. The sheets were changed about once a
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l38' n='N038'/>month; it was far from ideal when there were lice.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l39' n='N039'/>During my stay there was an epidemic of lice. The nuns told us
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l40' n='N040'/>to go to the kitchen and ask for vinegar, and we put it on our heads.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l41' n='N041'/>When it was dry we put on some powder, and then a scarf; we stayed
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l42' n='N042'/>like that for three days. If you had lice it was considered bad and no
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_2_1l43' n='N043'/>one approached you any more. One of the nuns made fun of me; she
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>said, &quot;If you washed every day. &quot; or something like that. I told her
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>that she had surely had them before me. It was the first time in my
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>life that I had them, so.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>The cells were searched pretty often, sometimes when we were
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>there, but mostly during the day when we were in the workshop. The
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>nuns looked for knives and candles we had gotten by exchange, or
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>other things we weren’t allowed to have. They also looked for mail
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>between inmates; we had the right to write letters to each other, but
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>not love letters. Once one of the nuns—a young one who must have
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>been under thirty—wrote to one of my friends. She told her that she
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>liked her and that she would like to have a closer relationship with
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>her. The letter was found and the nun in question was expelled. This
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>sort of thing happened from time to time.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>Everything we received from the outside was also searched. We
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>received our packages all cut up and opened. All our letters were
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>read, those that we got as well as those we sent. Some had practically
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>nothing in them, but they couldn’t go through because they were too
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>long. People wrote to us with the smallest writing possible because
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>one page, written very small, went through, but 2 pages, written in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>large letters, didn’t. As for the letters that we wrote, everything
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>concerning prison life, the nuns, or what we ate, was censored. We
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>could talk about the books we had read, and a minimum about what
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>we did, but that was all. In general, what went through or not
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>depended on the person who read the mail. Some letters that
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>shouldn’t have gone through went anyway, and vice versa.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>We were also searched when we left the prison. You couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>take out anything that might be a souvenir. One of my friends, for
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l28' n='N028'/>example, had made a drawing of a little girl taking water in her hand
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l29' n='N029'/>to offer a doe; they didn’t let her take her drawing out. In these
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l30' n='N030'/>searches you couldn’t really hide anything, and what was least likely
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l31' n='N031'/>to be found was what wasn’t hidden. In the end they looked more
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l32' n='N032'/>often into the girls&apos; vaginas to see if they had hidden letters than in
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l33' n='N033'/>the luggage. As for me, I had certain drawings and papers which
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l34' n='N034'/>normally I wouldn’t have been allowed to take out. I just left them
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l35' n='N035'/>with my things and they weren’t even seen.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l36' n='N036'/>It was on the eve of my departure that they told me that I was
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l37' n='N037'/>coming out. Until then I had no idea how long they were going to
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l38' n='N038'/>keep me. I could have gone out on probation before, but only on
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l39' n='N039'/>condition that they tell my mother. I preferred that they didn’t. Once
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l40' n='N040'/>out, I didn’t have the right to write to my inmate friends who stayed.
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l41' n='N041'/>Sundays were different from other days. In the morning, some
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l42' n='N042'/>went to church and the others stayed locked up in their cells, but we
				<lb facs='#facs_5_r_4_1l43' n='N043'/>could go into our friends&apos; cells. Afterwards we did the cleaning up
			</p>
			<pb n='6'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>That day we didn’t work, and we could sit where we liked in the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>workshop-mess hall. The nuns put the radio on, but they turned it off
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>as soon as the news came on. They didn’t let us know what was going
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>on in the outside world. To pass the time we played games. For
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>instance, we played truth games. We asked questions about incidents
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>that had happened a few days before and about which we hadn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l7' n='N007'/>managed to find out the truth. The girls were generally honest; you
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>couldn’t lie in that game, otherwise you didn’t play. But the biggest
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l9' n='N009'/>pastime was cards—Tarot, Belote. Some of them were played with
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l10' n='N010'/>real cards that some girls had managed to smuggle in. The others had
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l11' n='N011'/>been made with empty packs of Gitanes on which we had drawn.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l12' n='N012'/>Some girls tattooed themselves. They would take ink from ball
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l13' n='N013'/>point pens and mix it with cigarette ash. This way they managed to
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l14' n='N014'/>make an ink which was pretty indelible—blue-black. Then they took
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l15' n='N015'/>two needles, one projecting in front of the other, and put a drop of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l16' n='N016'/>ink between them. Then, with the projecting needle they made the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l17' n='N017'/>drop slip into the hole. This made a point; they made as many points
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l18' n='N018'/>as they wanted. They made snakes, hearts, names, but mostly just
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l19' n='N019'/>three points, which means &quot;Death to the Pigs,&quot; or five points¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l20' n='N020'/>&quot;Alone Between Four Walls.&quot; It was the emblem of prison.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l21' n='N021'/>We wrote all over ourselves with pens, and there were ways of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l22' n='N022'/>making up your face. With ashes from the stove in the hall and water
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l23' n='N023'/>we could make mascara. There were black felt pens that we could use
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l24' n='N024'/>as eyeliner, but it was hard to take off and we usually did it with shoe
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l25' n='N025'/>polish that we got at the canteen. We mostly made our eyes up, but
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l26' n='N026'/>some girls put brown pencil around their lips.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l27' n='N027'/>Some girls reacted badly to prison lite, but we tried to help them,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_2_1l28' n='N028'/>and they managed to make friends, to find people who helped them
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>overcome their distress. I wouldn’t leave a poor girl by herself who
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>arrived here and who looked completely lost. I went to see her,
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>talked to her. Of course there were those who had their husbands and
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>their children outside; for them it was harder. I was told that once a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>girl hanged herself. Sometimes there were also attempts at escape;
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>was told that one inmate hid herself in a garbage can, but she didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>have time to get out and was killed inside the garbage truck.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>At Christmas the Salvation Army came. We got together in the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>mess hall and listened to them sing Christmas carols. These women
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>were very nice. They gave each of us a towel, a handkerchief, and a
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>pack of candy. We had a lot of fun because we weren’t used to seeing
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>this sort of woman. Everybody was laughing, but they were well
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>received by the inmates. In the end we thought it was really nice of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>them to trouble themselves for us. I think a lot of the girls were
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>touched.
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>For the meal, we put all the tables together to be the most
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>together possible. Those who had saved a little money bought pas¬
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l18' n='N018'/>tries, but almost everything was shared. I, for example, didn’t have
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l19' n='N019'/>any money, but I had a little of everything like everybody else. On
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l20' n='N020'/>the part of the prison, there was nothing, except that we didn’t work
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l21' n='N021'/>that day and we could go to midnight mass. A lot of people were
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l22' n='N022'/>depressed that day; all this reminded us of our families and of all the
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l23' n='N023'/>things we were trying to forget. It was nice, this party, but actually it
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l24' n='N024'/>was painful. The monotony of the other days was better. We didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l25' n='N025'/>really give each other presents. We didn’t have the possibility of
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l26' n='N026'/>giving anything, except cigarettes. The girl I was going out with gave
				<lb facs='#facs_6_r_4_1l27' n='N027'/>me some cigarettes.
