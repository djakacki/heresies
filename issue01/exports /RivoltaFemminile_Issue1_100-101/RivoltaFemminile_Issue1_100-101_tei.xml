				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l1' n='N001'/>Rivolta Femminile is an Italian group of radical
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l2' n='N002'/>feminists founded in Rome in July 1970, now
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l3' n='N003'/>associated with other feminist groups in Milan,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l4' n='N004'/>Turin, Genoa and Florence. They have con¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l5' n='N005'/>sistently resisted hierarchal structures and male¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l6' n='N006'/>dominated institutions and their development
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l7' n='N007'/>of feminist theory has been detailed in publica¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l8' n='N008'/>tions such as Carla Lonzi&apos;s Sputiamo su Hegel
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l9' n='N009'/>(7970) and La Donna clitoridea e la donna vagi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l10' n='N010'/>nale (1977), the collective&apos;s Sessualita femmi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l11' n='N011'/>nile e aborto (1977) and Carla Accardi&apos;s Su¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l12' n='N012'/>periore e inferiore (1972). The latter records the
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l13' n='N013'/>author&apos;s dismissal from her job after discussing
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l14' n='N014'/>the Rivolta Femminile manifesto with her fe¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l15' n='N015'/>male high school students. All publications are
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l16' n='N016'/>available from Rivolta Femminile, Via del
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l17' n='N017'/>Babuino 16, Rome, Italy.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l18' n='N018'/>We in Rivolta Femminile refuse to pay tribute
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l19' n='N019'/>to male creativity because we are aware that in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l20' n='N020'/>the patriarchal world—that is, in a world made
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l21' n='N021'/>by men and for men—even the liberating force
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l1' n='N001'/>of creativity is the prerogative of men. Wom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l2' n='N002'/>an—in so many ways a subsidiary being—is
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l3' n='N003'/>denied every role which could effect à recogni¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l4' n='N004'/>tion of these inequities. For her, there is no
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l5' n='N005'/>prospect of liberation.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l6' n='N006'/>The creativity of men speaks to the creativity
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l7' n='N007'/>of other men while woman, as client and spec¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l8' n='N008'/>tator of that dialogue, is assigned a status which
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l9' n='N009'/>excludes competition. Woman is locked into a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l10' n='N010'/>role which, a priori, assures the male artist an
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l11' n='N011'/>audience. While creating art is seen to have a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l12' n='N012'/>liberating function, art as an institution insists
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l13' n='N013'/>that woman be the neutral witness to the work
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l14' n='N014'/>of others. Man’s energy, even in art, is spent by
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l15' n='N015'/>competing with other men. Only the contem¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l16' n='N016'/>plation of art invites woman&apos;s involvement.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l17' n='N017'/>This is the nature of patriarchal creativity: to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l18' n='N018'/>depend upon aggressive competition with male
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l19' n='N019'/>rivals and on the passive appreciation of wom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l20' n='N020'/>en. Man, the artist, feels abandoned by woman
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l21' n='N021'/>as soon as she abandons her archetypal specta¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l22' n='N022'/>tor&apos;s role; their mutual solidarity rests solely on
			</p>
			<pb n='2'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>the conviction that, as a spectator gratified by
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>creativity, woman reaches the highest possible
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>point in the evolution of her species.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>But, on the contrary, woman is discovering
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>that the patriarchal world needs her—that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l6' n='N006'/>man&apos;s self-liberating efforts absolutely depend
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l7' n='N007'/>on her—and that woman&apos;s liberation can only
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>be realized independent of patriarchal previ¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>sions and the dynamics by which men liberate
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>themselves. The artist depends upon woman to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l11' n='N011'/>glorify his work and she, until she begins her
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l12' n='N012'/>own liberation, is happy to oblige. The work of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l13' n='N013'/>art cannot afford to lose the security inherent in
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l14' n='N014'/>her exclusively receptive role.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l15' n='N015'/>Once aware of her position in relation to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l16' n='N016'/>male creativity, woman is left with two possi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l17' n='N017'/>bilities: the first—until now, the only available
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l18' n='N018'/>option—of distinguishing herself within the cre¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l19' n='N019'/>ative hierarchy historically defined by men
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l20' n='N020'/>(which alienates her from other women while
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l21' n='N021'/>men recognize her only indulgently); or—the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l22' n='N022'/>feminist alternative—of autonomously recover
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l23' n='N023'/>ing her own creativity, nourished by her aware¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l24' n='N024'/>ness of past oppression.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l25' n='N025'/>To celebrate male creativity is ultimately to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l26' n='N026'/>submit to the historic sovereignty of men, to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l27' n='N027'/>that patriarchal strategy which deliberately sub¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l28' n='N028'/>jugates us. But let woman remove herself, and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l29' n='N029'/>the struggle for male supremacy becomes not
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l30' n='N030'/>man lording it over woman, but merely a strug¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l31' n='N031'/>gle between individual men.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l32' n='N032'/>By refusing to celebrate male creativity, we
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l33' n='N033'/>are not judging creativity, nor are we contesting
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l34' n='N034'/>it. Rather, with our absence, we are refusing to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l35' n='N035'/>accept it as defined; we are challenging the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l36' n='N036'/>concept of art as something which men gra¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l37' n='N037'/>ciously hand down to us. By ceasing to believe
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l38' n='N038'/>in a refracted liberation, we are unleashing
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l39' n='N039'/>creative energy from patriarchal bonds.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l40' n='N040'/>With her absence, woman performs a dramat¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l41' n='N041'/>ic act of awareness, creative because it is liber¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l42' n='N042'/>ating.
