         <p>twelve years later, how funny running into you
			</p>
         <p>i remember you in glasses and a bowtie
				before mad avenue bought space
				in the revolution
				you are conscientiously updated
				you have let your hair grow longer
			</p>
         <p>in that slick packaged heaven
				where good admen go
				you will play electric harp
				you have remembered every moment
				all this time
				and remind me of it over steak
				which you have paid for
				your revolution balks at going dutch
				mine will be vegetarian by next week
				but just this once i'Il buy your buying me
				mysteak
				i'm curious to remember how it feels
				i took my diaphragm everywhere in those days
				the only part i remember is when you said
				why don’t we go ahead, do what we’ve both been thinking
				but i hadn’t, honestly, or i would never
				have put my flannel nightgown on
				sorry, i don’t remember
				anything that happened after that
				it was all so long ago
				and meant so little
				twelve years ago, before the revolution
				it was usually too much trouble to say no
				especially when the man had bought you
				steak
				you are curious to remember how it feels
				but i have chewed and sat with downcast eyes
			</p>
         <p>letting you tell some patent Barbie me
				that i'm more womanly (sic) than your ex-wife
				and feel i've paid enough
				thanks for the steak, good seeing you again
				imouth, let's get together soon
				i do not say, there’s been a revolution
				and there have been too many one night stands
