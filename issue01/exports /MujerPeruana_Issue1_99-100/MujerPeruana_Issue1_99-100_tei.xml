			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>We are a group of women who have orga¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>nized to study, work and fight for our liberation,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>and especially to work with and for our sisters
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l4' n='N004'/>who suffer a double oppression: in being wom¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l5' n='N005'/>en and in belonging to a social sector which has
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_2_1l6' n='N006'/>been historically dominated and exploited.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>The struggle of women is integrally bound to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>the struggle of working-class women.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>No! to Mother&apos;s Day.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>Yes! to Peruvian Woman&apos;s Day.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_3_1l5' n='N005'/>Less homage, more rights.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>Why are we named Action for the Liberation
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>of Peruvian Women?
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>Because we want to carry out our work with¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>out euphemisms or timidity—in short, without
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>masks or half-measures. It is correct to call
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>actions which are destined to radically change
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>our condition by their rightful name: liberation.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>Ours is simultaneously a study-group and an
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>action-group. We are by no means a political
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>party. We do not aspire to be an institution with
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>traditional hierarchic structure. We reject ver¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>ticalism, dogmatism and leadership positions.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>Ideologically, we align ourselves within free
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>Humanist Socialism and adopt the best of its
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>tenets conducive to female emancipation.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>Without national liberation, there can be no
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>women&apos;s liberation. Fight!
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>Only reactionary men are our enemies!
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>Sisters, Unite with us!
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>Liberation is action!
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l1' n='N001'/>Because we cannot separate our specific
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l2' n='N002'/>problems from our socio-economic context, all
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l3' n='N003'/>our work strategies are adapted to the actual
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l4' n='N004'/>conditions of our country. We do not copy
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l5' n='N005'/>foreign movements because we are aware of
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l6' n='N006'/>living in a Third-World Society where imperjal¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l7' n='N007'/>ism is our most powerful enemy. Therefore we
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l8' n='N008'/>express solidarity with other liberation struggles
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l9' n='N009'/>on this continent, as well as with other women
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>and men fighting for national liberation in their
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l11' n='N011'/>respective countries.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l1' n='N001'/>To analyze the historic and social origins of our
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l2' n='N002'/>condition is to revolutionize our understanding
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l3' n='N003'/>of the worldl
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l1' n='N001'/>We believe our liberation is inseparable from
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l2' n='N002'/>that of other oppressed groups—workers and
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l3' n='N003'/>peasants. The liberation of our brothers will
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l4' n='N004'/>never be realized while their women—workers
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l5' n='N005'/>and peasants too—are second-class citizens,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l6' n='N006'/>and while prostitution is seen as a &quot;necessary
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l7' n='N007'/>and insuperable evil.“
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l8' n='N008'/>Consequently we do not believe in individual
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l9' n='N009'/>liberation. The fact that some of our sisters are
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l10' n='N010'/>being promoted to important public positions
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l11' n='N011'/>or are gaining access to professional and tech¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l12' n='N012'/>nical careers in increasingly greater numbers
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l13' n='N013'/>has nothing to do with liberation. We believe
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l14' n='N014'/>that only structural change will produce real
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l15' n='N015'/>&quot;women&apos;s liberation.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l16' n='N016'/>So our position, our actions, are aimed at
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l17' n='N017'/>contributing to the process of transformation
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l18' n='N018'/>taking place in our country, at helping it
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l19' n='N019'/>strengthen and advance without obstacles. We
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l20' n='N020'/>support this Revolution because it is anti¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l21' n='N021'/>imperialist and anti-oligarchic, and because it
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l22' n='N022'/>makes possible our own liberation.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l23' n='N023'/>What do we call Cultural Revolution?
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l24' n='N024'/>The process by which the old system is entire¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l25' n='N025'/>ly questioned and revised: its values, behavior,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l26' n='N026'/>habits, customs, institutions and forms of com¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l27' n='N027'/>munication. A Cultural Revolution must reject
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l28' n='N028'/>all individualism, engendering a collective way
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l29' n='N029'/>of life harmonious with group ideals, while re¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l30' n='N030'/>sistant to group egoism. A Cultural Revolution
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l31' n='N031'/>must combat stereotypical attitudes like &quot;male¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l32' n='N032'/>ism&quot; (machismo) and &quot;femaleism&quot; (hembrismo)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l33' n='N033'/>—brute maleness and coy femaleness. A Cul¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l34' n='N034'/>tural Revolution must change patriarchal insti¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l35' n='N035'/>tutions like bourgeois marriage and the nuclear
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l36' n='N036'/>family—two characteristic expressions of capi¬
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l37' n='N037'/>talism and the division of labor. Finally, a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l38' n='N038'/>Cultural Revolution&apos;s ultimate goal must be to
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l39' n='N039'/>change life, to culminate in a free and humane
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_8_1l40' n='N040'/>socialism.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_9_1l1' n='N001'/>Wanting to shape your own destiny is wanting
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_9_1l2' n='N002'/>to transform injustice.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_9_1l3' n='N003'/>Wanting to transform injustice is being political.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l1' n='N001'/>What do we want to be liberated from?
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l2' n='N002'/>From the social, economic, political, cultural
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l3' n='N003'/>and moral conditions imposed by a patriarchal
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l4' n='N004'/>capitalist society which assigns us secondary
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l5' n='N005'/>roles, condemning us to live as marginal beings
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l6' n='N006'/>passively supporting and &quot;servicing&quot; men.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l7' n='N007'/>From reformist paternalism which perpetually
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_10_1l8' n='N008'/>treats us as legal minors, because it reduces

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l1' n='N001'/>everything to the creation or amplification of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l2' n='N002'/>protectionary laws that are pretexts to mask our
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l3' n='N003'/>real situation of dependence on men and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l4' n='N004'/>second-class citizenship.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l5' n='N005'/>From all kinds of ideological pressure, ex¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l8' n='N008'/>tion that if we do so, we must be &quot;against men.“
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l9' n='N009'/>From the fear of being ridiculed or insulted as
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1l10' n='N010'/>tomboys,&quot; &quot;whores,&quot; or &quot;dykes.&quot;
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l1' n='N001'/>Statistics affirm that few women are workers.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l2' n='N002'/>Out of the home and onto the production lines!
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l3' n='N003'/>Working women also carry the burden of the

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_2_1l8' n='N008'/>Being a mother and being fulfilled shouldn’t be

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l1' n='N001'/>Against whom must we struggle?
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l2' n='N002'/>Against the Patriarchal-Capitalist System
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l3' n='N003'/>which determines an unjust society, fostering
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_3_1l4' n='N004'/>exploitation, abuse, discrimination, hunger,
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>wars and massacres; a system which transforms
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>woman into a beast of burden (if she is prole¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>tarian), or into a luxury sex-object (if she is bour¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>geois). Capitalism has also reviled love, reduc¬
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>ing male-female relationships to economic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>factors or to mere social appearances. It is a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>system in which children are the responsibility
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>of individual couples and, in actual practice, of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>the women alone.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>Against all sexist ideology which gains by re¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>is expressed in the cult of &quot;femininity“—sweet¬

				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>woman&apos;s only aim and destiny.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>And finally, against all threats to the libera¬
