				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l1' n='N001'/>There is no need now to rush about my life,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l2' n='N002'/>have time, each day, to unfold
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l3' n='N003'/>carefully, my rage —
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l4' n='N004'/>no longer impotent,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l5' n='N005'/>But the most powerful force in the universe.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l6' n='N006'/>(Do you hear me, Mother?)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l7' n='N007'/>Slowly like a sunflower like a tree,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l8' n='N008'/>Revolution unfolds before me:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l9' n='N009'/>Newspaper pages beginning with world news,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l10' n='N010'/>and ending with the comics,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l11' n='N011'/>and classified ads announcing the end
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l12' n='N012'/>of things as we know them.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l13' n='N013'/>Inevitably the world, the nation, the city,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l14' n='N014'/>the arts, society, sports
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l15' n='N015'/>and personals
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l16' n='N016'/>will be recycled
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_4_1l17' n='N017'/>By patient origamists, armed with love.

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l1' n='N001'/>Questionnaire
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l2' n='N002'/>There is unfeminine (but oh, so Female)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l3' n='N003'/>sureness in my hands,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l4' n='N004'/>checking &quot;No.&quot; to every question
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l5' n='N005'/>in the Harris poll, Reader&apos;s Digest,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l6' n='N006'/>Mademoiselle,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l7' n='N007'/>I am an outlaw, so none of that applies to me:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l8' n='N008'/>I do not vote in primaries, do not wish to increase
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l9' n='N009'/>my spending power, do not take birth control
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l10' n='N010'/>pills.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l11' n='N011'/>I do not have a legal residence, cannot tell you
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l12' n='N012'/>my given name or how (sometimes very) old
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l13' n='N013'/>I really am.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l14' n='N014'/>I do not travel abroad, see no humor in uniforms,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l15' n='N015'/>and my lips are good enough for my lover
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l16' n='N016'/>as they are.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l17' n='N017'/>Beyond that, no one heads my household, I would not
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l18' n='N018'/>save my marriage if l&apos;had one, or anybody else&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l19' n='N019'/>if I could.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l20' n='N020'/>I do not believe that politicians need me, that Jesus
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l21' n='N021'/>loves me, or that short men are particularly sexy.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l22' n='N022'/>Nor do l want a penis.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_5_1l23' n='N023'/>What else do you have to offer?
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l1' n='N001'/>Gentlemen of the Jury:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l2' n='N002'/>l have had the time and opportunity to appear
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l3' n='N003'/>before you in the guise
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l4' n='N004'/>(disguise) of every woman:
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l5' n='N005'/>to you, sir, l was the dumb hand
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l6' n='N006'/>that wiped your
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l7' n='N007'/>table,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l8' n='N008'/>to you, sir, a flimsy black
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l9' n='N009'/>skirt on legs,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l10' n='N010'/>to you, some hard
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l11' n='N011'/>down-on-me woman who might
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l12' n='N012'/>(or might not) yet
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l13' n='N013'/>be downed again.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l14' n='N014'/>To him, an ass,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l15' n='N015'/>to him, a breast, a leg
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l16' n='N016'/>to him.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l17' n='N017'/>To that one, just another working bitch.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l18' n='N018'/>To each, another history, to each
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l19' n='N019'/>another (partial) lie.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l20' n='N020'/>We women are liars, you say.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l21' n='N021'/>(It is written.)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l22' n='N022'/>But you have made us so.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l23' n='N023'/>We are too much caught up in cycles, you say.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l24' n='N024'/>But your gods cannot prevent that.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l25' n='N025'/>So we act out our cycles,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l26' n='N026'/>one or many,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l27' n='N027'/>in the rhythm of what has to be
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l28' n='N028'/>(because we say so)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l29' n='N029'/>our common destiny.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l30' n='N030'/>And so, before you are taken in by one of our
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l31' n='N031'/>perfect circles,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l32' n='N032'/>remember also that we are in perfect
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l33' n='N033'/>motion.
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l34' n='N034'/>And when you (and you will)
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l35' n='N035'/>run counter to the flow of revolution,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l36' n='N036'/>the wheel of women will continue to turn,
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l37' n='N037'/>and grind you
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_6_1l38' n='N038'/>so fine.

				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l1' n='N001'/>Susan Saxe wrote this and other poems while she was living
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l2' n='N002'/>underground as a fugitive for 4½ years, during which time
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l3' n='N003'/>she was on the F.B.I.&apos;s.Ten Most Wanted List for &quot;overall
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l4' n='N004'/>radical activities.&quot; On March 27, 1975, she was arrested in
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l5' n='N005'/>Philadelphia and since then has been tried for allegedly
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l6' n='N006'/>taking part in a Boston bank robbery 7 years ago in which a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l7' n='N007'/>policeman was killed. Saxe became &quot;a feminist, a lesbian, a
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l8' n='N008'/>woman-identified woman&quot; while underground. She is now
				<lb facs='#facs_1_r_7_1l9' n='N009'/>in prison awaiting sentence.
