         <head><title>Notes From the First Year
				(for my sisters, a trilogy of revolution)
			</title>

         <p>62
				Patience
				Argue My Case
			</p>
         <p>There is no need now to rush about my life,
				have time, each day, to unfold
				carefully, my rage —
				no longer impotent,
				But the most powerful force in the universe.
				(Do you hear me, Mother?)
				Slowly like a sunflower like a tree,
				Revolution unfolds before me:
				Newspaper pages beginning with world news,
				and ending with the comics,
				and classified ads announcing the end
				of things as we know them.
				Inevitably the world, the nation, the city,
				the arts, society, sports
				and personals
				will be recycled
				By patient origamists, armed with love.
			</p>
         <p>Questionnaire
				There is unfeminine (but oh, so Female)
				sureness in my hands,
				checking "No." to every question
				in the Harris poll, Reader's Digest,
				Mademoiselle,
				I am an outlaw, so none of that applies to me:
				I do not vote in primaries, do not wish to increase
				my spending power, do not take birth control
				pills.
				I do not have a legal residence, cannot tell you
				my given name or how (sometimes very) old
				I really am.
				I do not travel abroad, see no humor in uniforms,
				and my lips are good enough for my lover
				as they are.
				Beyond that, no one heads my household, I would not
				save my marriage if l'had one, or anybody else's
				if I could.
				I do not believe that politicians need me, that Jesus
				loves me, or that short men are particularly sexy.
				Nor do l want a penis.
				What else do you have to offer?
			</p>
         <p>Gentlemen of the Jury:
				l have had the time and opportunity to appear
				before you in the guise
				(disguise) of every woman:
				to you, sir, l was the dumb hand
				that wiped your
				table,
				to you, sir, a flimsy black
				skirt on legs,
				to you, some hard
				down-on-me woman who might
				(or might not) yet
				be downed again.
				To him, an ass,
				to him, a breast, a leg
				to him.
				To that one, just another working bitch.
				To each, another history, to each
				another (partial) lie.
				We women are liars, you say.
				(It is written.)
				But you have made us so.
				We are too much caught up in cycles, you say.
				But your gods cannot prevent that.
				So we act out our cycles,
				one or many,
				in the rhythm of what has to be
				(because we say so)
				our common destiny.
				And so, before you are taken in by one of our
				perfect circles,
				remember also that we are in perfect
				motion.
				And when you (and you will)
				run counter to the flow of revolution,
				the wheel of women will continue to turn,
				and grind you
				so fine.

         <p>Susan Saxe wrote this and other poems while she was living
				underground as a fugitive for 4½ years, during which time
				she was on the F.B.I.'s.Ten Most Wanted List for "overall
				radical activities." On March 27, 1975, she was arrested in
				Philadelphia and since then has been tried for allegedly
				taking part in a Boston bank robbery 7 years ago in which a
				policeman was killed. Saxe became "a feminist, a lesbian, a
				woman-identified woman" while underground. She is now
				in prison awaiting sentence.
