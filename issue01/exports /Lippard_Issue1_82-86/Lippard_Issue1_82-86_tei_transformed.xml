			<head><title>The Pink Glass Swan: Upward ond Downward Mobility in the Art World</title><lb/>
				<persName>Lucy R.Lippard</persName></head>
			<p>The general alienation of contemporary avant-garde art from any broad audience has
				been crystallized in the women's movement. From the beginning, both liberal
				feminists con- cerned with changing women's personal lives and socialist feminists
				concerned with over- throwing the classist/racist/sexist foundations of society have
				agreed that "fine" art is more or less irrelevant, though holding out the hope that
				feminist art could and should be different. The American women artists' movement has
				concentrated its efforts on gaining power within its own interest group-the art
				world, in itself an incestuous network of relationships between artists and art on
				the one hand and dealers publishers, buyers on the other. The "public," the
				"masses," or the "audience" is hardly considered.</p>
			<p> The art world has evolved its own curious class system. Externally this is a
				microcosm of capitalist society, but it maintains an internal dialectic (or just
				plain contradiction) that at- tempts to reverse or ignore that parallel. Fame may be
				a higher currency than mere money, but the two tend to go together. Since the buying
				and selling of art and artists is done by the ruling classes or by those chummy with
				them and their institutions, all artists or producers, no matter what their
				individual economic back- grounds are dependent on the owners and forced into a
				proletarian role-just as women, in Engels' analysis, play proletarian to the male
				ruler across all class boundaries. Looking at and "appreciating" art in this century
				has been understood as an instrument (or at best a result) of upward social mobility
				in which owning art is the ultimate step. Making art is at the bottom of the scale.
				This is the only legitimate reason to see artists as so many artists see
				themselves-as "workers." At the same time, artists/maker tend to feel misunderstood
				and, as creators, innately superior to the buyers/owners. The innermost circle of
				the art-world class system thereby replaces the rulers with the creators, and the
				contemporary artist in the big city (read New York) is a schizophrenic creature.
				S/he is persistently working "up" to be accepted, not only by other artists but also
				by the hierarchy that exhibits, writes about, and buys her/his work. At the same
				time s/he is often ideologi- cally working "down" in an attempt to identify with the
				workers outside of the art context, and to overthrow the rulers in the name of art.
				This conflict is augmented by the fact that most artists are originally from the
				middle class, and their approach to the bourgeoisie includes a touch of adolescent
				rebellion against authority. Those few who have actually emerged from the working
				class sometimes use this-their very lack of background privilege-as privilege in
				itself, while playing the same schizophrenic foreground role as their solidly
				middle-class colleagues.</p>
			<p> Artists, then, are workers or at least producers even when they don't know it. Yet
				artists dressed in work clothes (or expensive imitations thereof) and producing a
				commodity accessible only to the rich differ drastically from the real working class
				in that artists control their pro- duction and their product-or could if they
				realized it and if they had the strength to main- tain that control. In the studio,
				at least, unlike the farm, the factory, and the mine, the unor- ganized worker is in
				superficial control and can, if s/he dares, talk down to or tell off the boss - the
				collector, the curator, etc. For years now, with little effect, it has been pointed
				out to artists that the art-world superstructure cannot run without them. Art, after
				all, is the product on which all the money is made and the power based.</p>
			<p> During the 1950s and 1960s most American artists were unaware that they did not
				control their art, that their art could be used not only for esthetic pleasure or
				decoration or status symbols, but also as an educational weapon. In the late 1960s,
				between the Black, the student, the anti-war and the women's movements, the facts of
				the exploitation of art in and out of the art world emerged. Most artists and
				artworkers still ignore these issues because they make us feel too uncomfortable and
				helpless. Yet if there were a strike against museums and gal - leries to allow
				artists control of their work, the scabs would be out immediately in full force,
				with reasons ranging from self-interest to total lack of political awareness to a
				genuine belief that society would crumble without art, that art is "above it all."
				Or is it in fact below it all, as most political activists seem to think?</p>
			<p> Another aspect of this conflict surfaces in dis- cussions around who gets a "piece
				of the pie" - a phrase which has become the scornful desig- nation for what is
				actually most peoples goal. (Why shouldn't artists be able to make a living in this
				society like everybody else? Well, almost <pb n="83"/> everybody else.) Those working
				for "cultural change" through political theonizing and occasional actions are
				opposed to anybody getting a piece of the pie, though politics appears to be getting
				fashionable again in the art world and may itself provide a vehicle for internal
				success; today one can refuse a piece of the pie and simultaneously be getting a
				chance at it. Still, the pie is very small and there are a lot of hungry people
				circling it. Things were bad enough when only men were allowed to take a bite. Since
				"aggressive women" have gotten in there too, competition, always at the heart of the
				art-world class system, has peaked.</p>
			<p> Attendance at any large art school in the U.S. takes students from all classes and
				trains them for artists' schizophrenia. While being cool and chicly grubby (in the
				"uniform" of mass produc - tion), and knowing what's the latest in taste and what's
				the kind of art to make and the right names to drop is clearly "upward mobility" -
				from school into teaching jobs and/or the art world-the lifestyle accompanying these
				habits is heavily weighted "downward." The working - class girl who has had to work
				for nice clothes must drop into frayed jeans to make it into the art middle ciass,
				which in turn considers itself both upper and lower class. Choosing poverty is a
				confusing experence for a child whose parents (or more likely mother) have tried des
				- perately against great odds to keep a clean and pleasant home. <note type="researchNote">Class and Feminism, ed. Charlotte Bunch and Nancy Myron (Baltimore, 1974). This book contains some excrutiating insights for the middle-class feminist; it raised my consciousness and inspired this essay (along with other recent experiences and conversations).</note> </p>
			<p> The artist who feels superior to the rich be - cause s/he is disguised as someone
				who is poor provides a puzzle for the truly deprived. A par- allel notion, rarely
				admitted but pervasive, is that a person can't understand "art" if their house is
				full of pink glass swans or their lawn is inhabited by gnomes and flamingos, or if
				they even care about house and clothes at all. This is particularly ridiculous now,
				when art itself uses so much of this paraphernalia (and not always satirically); or,
				from another angle, when even artists who have no visible means of profes- sional
				support live in palatial lofts and sport beat-up $100 boots while looking down on
				the "tourists" who come to SoHo to see art on Saturdays; SoHo is, in fact, the new
				suburbia. One reason for such callousness is a hangover from the 1950s, when artists
				really were poor and proud of being poor because their art, the argument went, must
				be good if the bad guys - the rich and the masses- didn't like it.</p>
			<p> In the 1960s the choice of poverty, often excused as anti-consumerism, even
				infiltrated the esthetics of art. <note type="researchNote">Actually nothing new; the history of modern art demonstrates a constant longing for the primitive, the simple, the clear, the "poor," the noble naif, etc.</note> First there was Pop Art, modeled on kitsch, on
				advertising and consu - merism, and equally successful on its own level. (Women,
				incidentally, participated little in Pop Art, partly because of its blatant sexism,
				some - times presented as a parody of the image of woman in the media - and partly
				because the subject matter was often "women's work," ennobled and acceptable only
				when the artists were men.) Then came Process Art-a rebellion against the "precious
				object" traditionally desired and bought by the rich. Here another kind of
				co-optation took place, when temporary piles of dirt, oil, rags and filthy rubber
				began to grace carpeted living rooms. The Italian branch was even called Arte
				Povera. Then came the rise of a third-stream medium called "conceptual art" which
				offered "anti-objects" in the form of ideas-books or simple xeroxed texts and photo-
				graphs with no inherent physical or monetary value (until they got on the market,
				that is). Conceptual art seemed politically viable be- cause of its notion that the
				use of ordinary, inexpensive, unbulky media would lead to a kind of socialization
				(or at least democratiza- tion) of art as opposed to gigantic canvases and huge
				chrome sculptures costing five figures and filling the world with more consumer
				fetishes.</p>
			<p> Yet the trip from of on canvas to ideas on xerox was, in retrospect, yet another
				instance of "downward mobility" or middle-class guilt. It was no accident that
				conceptual art appeared at the height of the social movements of the late 1960s nor
				that the artists were sympathetic to those movements (with the qualified exception
				of the women's movement). All of the esthetic tendencies listed above were genuinely
				insti - gated as rebellions by the artists themselves, yet the fact remains that
				only rich people can afford to 1) spend money on art that won't last; 2) live with
				"ugly art" or art that is not decorative, because the rest of their surroundings are
				beau - tiful and comfortable; 3) like "non-object art" which is only handy If you
				already have too many possessions-when it becomes a reaction - ary commentary: art
				for the overprivileged in a consumer society.</p>
			<p> As a child, I was accused by my parents of being an "anti-snob snob" and I'm only
				begin - ning to see the limitations of such a rebellion. Years later I was an early
				supporter of and pros - elytizer for conceptual art as escape from the commodity
				orientation of the art world, a way of communicating with a broader audience via
				inexpensive media. Though I was bitterly dis - appointed (with the social, not the
				esthetic achievements) when I found that this work could be so easily absorbed into
				the system, it is only now that I've realized why the absorption took place.
				Conceptual art's democratic efforts and physical vehicles were cancelled out by its
				neutral, elitist content and its patronizing ap- proach. From around 1967 to 1971,
				most of us involved in conceptual art saw that content as pretty revolutionary and
				thought of ourselves as rebels against the cool, hostile artifacts of the prevailing
				formalist and minimal art. But we were so totally enveloped in the middle-class
				approach to everything we did and saw, we couldn't perceive how that pseudo-academic
				narrative piece or that art-world-oriented action <pb n="3"/> in the streets was
				deprived of any revolutionary content by the fact that it was usually incom -
				prehensible and alienating to the people "out there," no matter how fashionably
				downwardly mobile it might be in the art world. The idea that if art is subversive
				in the art world it will automatically appeal to a general audience now seems
				absurd.</p>
			<p> The whole evolutionary basis of modernist innovation, the idea of esthetic
				"progress," the "I-did-it-first" and "it's-been-done-already" syn - dromes which
				pervade contemporary avant - garde art and criticism, are also blatantly class- ist,
				and have more to do with technology than with art. To be "avant-garde" is inevitably
				to be on top or to become upper-middle-class, be - cause such innovations take place
				in a context accessible only to the educated elite. Thus socially conscious artists
				working in or with community groups and muralists try to dis - associate themselves
				from the art world, even though its values ("quality") remain to haunt them
				personally.</p>
			<p> The value systems are different in and out of the art world, and anyone attempting
				to strad - dle the two develops another kind of schizo - phrenia. For instance, in
				the inner-city com - munity murals, as Eva Cockcroft points out else - where in this
				publication, the images of woman are the traditional ones-a beautiful, noble mother
				and housewife or worker, and a re - bellious young woman striving to change her
				world-both of them celebrated for their cour - age to be and to stay the way they
				are and to support their men in the face of horrendous odds. This is not the
				art-world or middle-class "radical" view of future feminism, nor is it one which
				radical feminists hoping to "reach out" across the classes can easily espouse. Here,
				in the realm of aspirations, is where upward and downward mobility and status quo
				clash, where the economic class barriers are established. As Michele Russell has
				noted, <note type="researchNote">Michele Russell, "Woman and Third World," New American Movement (June, 1973).</note> the Third-World woman is not attracted to the "Utopian experi - mentation"
				of the left (in the art world, the would-be Marxist avant-garde) or to the "prag-
				matic opportunism" of the right (in the art world, those who reform and co-opt the
				"radicals").</p>
			<p> Many of the subjects touched on here come back to Taste. To a poor woman, art, or a
				beau - tiful object, might be defined as something she cannot have. Beauty and art
				have been defined before as the desirable. In a consumer society, art too becomes a
				commodity rather than a life- enhancing experience. Yet the Van Gogh repro - duction
				or the pink glass swan-the same beautiful objects that may be "below" a middle -
				class woman (because she has, in moving up- ward, acquired upper-class taste, or
				would like to think she has)-may be "above" or inacces - sible to a welfare mother.
				The phrase "to dictate taste" has its own political connotations. Minneapolis worker
				Interviewed by students of artist Don Celender said he liked "old art works because
				they're more classy," <note type="researchNote">Opinions of Working People Concerning the Arts, ed. Don Celender (New York, 1975)</note> and class does seem to be what the traditional notion of art
				is all about. Yet contemporary avant-garde art, for all its attempts to break out of
				that gold frame, is equally class-bound, and even the artist aware of these
				contradictions in her/his own life and work is hard-put to resolve them. It's a
				vicious circle If the artist/producer is upper-middle- class, and our standards of
				art as taught in schools are persistently upper-middle-class, how do we escape
				making art only for the upper-middle-class?</p>
			<p> The alternatives to "quality," to the "high" art shown in art-world galleries and
				magazines have been few, and for the most part unsatis- fying, although
				well-intended. Even when kitsch, politics or housework are absorbed into art,
				contact with the real world is not neces - sarily made. At no time has the avant
				garde, though playing in the famous "gap between art and life," moved far enough out
				of the art con - text to attract a broad audience-that audience which has,
				ironically, been trained to think of art as something that has nothing to do with
				life and, at the same time, tends only to like that art which means something in
				terms of its own life, or fantasies. The dilemma for the leftist artist in the
				middle class is that her/his standards seem to have been set irremediably. No matter
				how much we know about what the broader public wants, or needs, it is very difficult
				to break social conditioning and cultural habits. Hope - fully, a truly feminist art
				will provide other standards.</p>
			<p> To understand the woman artist's position in this complex situation between the art
				world and the real world, class and gender, it is neces - sary to know that in
				America artists are rarely respected unless they are stars or rich or mad or dead.
				Being an artist is not being "somebody." Middle-class families are happy to pay lip
				ser - vice to art but god forbid their own children take it so seriously as to
				consider it a profession. Thus a man who becomes an artist is asked when he is going
				to "go to work," and he is not- so-covertly considered a child, a sissy (a wom -
				an), someone who has a hobby rather than a vocation, someone who can't make money
				and therefore cannot hold his head up in the real world of men—at least until his
				work sells, at which point he may be welcomed back. Male artists, bending over
				backward to rid them - selves of this stigma, tend to be particularly susceptible to
				insecurity and machismo. So women daring to insist on their place in the primary
				rank-as art makers rather than as art housekeepers (curators, critics, dealers, "pa
				- trons")-inherit a heavy burden of male fears in addition to the economic and
				psychological <pb n="4"/> discrimination still rampant in a patriarchal,
				money-oriented society.</p>
			<p> Most art being shown now has lttle to do with any woman's experience, in part
				because women-rich ones as "patrons," others as decorators and "home-makers" —are in
				charge of the private sphere, while men identify more easily with public art-art
				that has become public through economic validation (the mil - lion-dollar
				Rembrandt). Private art is often seen as mere ornament; public art is associated
				with monuments and money, with "high" art and its containers, including unwelcoming
				white - walled galleries and museums with classical courthouse architecture. Even
				the graffiti art - ists, whose work was unsuccessfully transferred from subways to
				art galleries, were all men, concerned with facades, with having their names in
				spray paint, in lights, in museums...</p>
			<p> Private art is visible only to intimates. I suspect the reason so few women "folk"
				artists work outdoors in large scale (like Simon Rodia's Watts Towers and other
				"naives and visionaries" with their cement and bottles) is not only be- cause men
				aspire to erections and know how to use the necessary tools, but because women can
				and must assuage these same creative urges inside the house, with the pink glass
				swan as an element in their own works of art-the living room or kitchen. In the art
				world the situation is doubly paralleled. Women's art until recently was rarely seen
				in public and all artists are voluntarily "women" because of the social atti - tudes
				mentioned above; the art world is so small that it is "private."</p>
			<p> Just as the living room is enclosed by the building it is in, art and artist are
				firmly im - prisoned by the culture which supports them. Artists claiming to work
				for themselves alone, and not for any audience at all, are passively accepting the
				upper-middle class audience of the internal art world. This is compounded by the
				fact that to be middle-class is to be passive, to live with the expectation of being
				taken care of and entertained. But art should be a con - sciousness-raiser; it
				partakes of and should fuse the private and the public spheres. It should be able to
				reintegrate the personal without being satisfied by the merely personal. One good
				test is whether or not it communicates, and then, of course, what and how it
				communicates. If it doesn't communicate it may just not be very good art from
				anyone's point of view; or it may be that the artist is not even aware of the needs
				of others, or simply doesn't care.</p>
			<p> For there is a need out there, a need vaguely satisfied at the moment by "schlock." <note type="researchNote">Bernard Kirchenbaum, in correspondence. Celender, op. cit., offers proof of this need and of the huge (and amazing) interest in art expressed by the working class, though it should be said that much of what is called art would not be agreed upon by the taste dictators.</note> And it seems that one of the basic tenets of the femin - ist arts should be a
				reaching out from the private sphere to transform that "artificial art" and to more
				fully satisfy that need. For the art-world artist has come to consider her/his
				private needs paramount, and has too often forgotten about those of the audience,
				any audience. Work that communicates to a dangerous num - ber of people is
				derogatorily called a "crowd pleaser." This is a blatantly classist attitude, taking
				for granted that most people are by na - ture incapable of understanding good art
				(ie., upper-class or quality art). At the same time, much ado is made about
				art-educational theo - ries that claim to "teach people to see" (con - sider the
				political implications of this notion) and muffle all issues by stressing the
				"universal- ity" of great art.</p>
			<p> It may be that at the moment the possibilities are slim for a middle-class art
				world's under - standing or criticism of the little art we see that reflects
				working-class cultural values. Perhaps our current responsibility lies in humanizing
				our own activities so that they will communicate more effectively with all women.
				Hopefully we will aspire to more than women's art flooding the museum and gallery
				circuit. Perhaps a femi - nist art will only emerge when we become whol - ly
				responsible for our own work, for what be - comes of it, who sees it, and who is
				nourished by it. For a feminist artist, whatever her style, the prime audience at
				this time is other women. So far, we have tended to be satisfied with com -
				municating with those women whose social experience is close to ours. This is
				natural enough, since this is where we will get our greatest support, and we need
				support in taking this risk of trying to please women, knowing that we are almost
				certain to displease men in the process. In addition, it is embarrassing to talk
				openly about the class system which divides us, hard to do so without sounding more
				bour - geois than ever in the implications of superiority and inferiority inherent
				in such discussions (where the working class is as often considered superior as the
				middle class).</p>
			<p> A book of essays called Class and Feminism written by The Furies, a lesbian feminist
				collec- tive, makes clear that from the point of view of working-class women, class
				is a definite prob- lem within the women's movement. As Nancy Myron observes,
				middle-class women: <quote>can intellectualize, politicize, accuse, abuse and
					contribute money in order not to deal with their own classism. Even if they
					admit that class exists, they are not likely to admit that their behavior is a
					product of it. They will go through every painful detail of their lives to prove
					to me or another working-class woman that they really didn't have any privilege,
					that their family was exceptional, that they actually did have an uncle who
					worked in a factory. To ease anyone's guilt is not the point of talking about
					class... You don't get rid of oppression just by talking about it.</quote></p>

			<p>Women are more strenuously conditioned toward upward cultural mobility or "gentility"
				than men, which often results in the woman consciously betraying her class origins
				as a mat - ter of course. The hierarchies within the whole span of the middle class
				are most easily demar - cated by lifestyle and dress. For instance, the much-scorned
				"Queens housewife" may have enough to eat, may have learned to consume the
				unnecessities, and may have made it to a desired social bracket in her community,
				but if she ventures to make art (not just own it), she will find herself back at the
				bottom in the art world, looking wistfully up to the plateau where the male, the
				young, the bejeaned seem so at ease.</p>
			<p> For middle-class women in the art world not only dress "down," but dress like
				working-class men. They do so because housedresses, pedal pushers, polyester
				pantsuits, perrnanents, the wrong accents are not such acceptable disguis - es for
				women as the boots, overalls and wind - breaker syndromes are for men. Thus young
				middle-class women tend to deny their female counterparts and take on "male"
				(unisex) attire. It may at times have been chic to dress like a native American or a
				Bedouin woman, but it has never been chic to dress like a working - class woman,
				even if she's trying to look like Jackie Kennedy. Young working-class women (and
				men) spend a large amount of avallable money on clothes; it's a way to forget the
				rats and roaches by which even the cleanest tene - ment-dwellers are blessed, or the
				mortgages by which even the hardest-working homeowners are blessed, and to present a
				classy facade. Artists dressing and talking "down" insult the hardhat much as rich
				kids in rags do; they insult people whose notion of art is something to work for-the
				pink glass swan.</p>
			<p> Yet women, as evidenced by the Furies' publi - cation, and as pointed out elsewhere
				(most not- ably by Bebel), have a unique chance to com - municate with women across
				the boundaries of economic class because as a "vertical class" we share the majority
				of our most fundamental experiences-emotionally, even when econom - cally we are
				divided. Thus an economic analy - sis does not adequately explore the psychologi -
				cal and esthetic ramifications of the need for change within a sexually oppressed
				group. Nor does it take into consideration that women's needs are different from
				men's-or so it seems at this still unequal point in history. The vertical class cuts
				across the horizontal economic class - es in a column of injustices. While
				heightened class consciousness can only clarify the way we see the world, and all
				clarification is for the better, I can't bring myself to trust hard lines and
				categories where fledgling feminism is concerned.</p>
			<p> Even in the art world, the issue of feminism has barely been raised in mixed
				political groups. In 1970, women took our rage and our energies to our own
				organizations, or directly to the public by means of picketing and protests. While a
				few men supported these, and most politically conscious male artists now claim to be
				feminists to some degree, the political and apolitical art world goes on as though
				feminism didn't exist-the presence of a few vociferous feminist artists and critics
				not withstanding. And in the art world, as in the real world, political commitment
				frequently means total disregard for feminist priorities. Even the increasingly
				Marxist group ironically calling itself Art- Language is unwilling to stop the
				exclusive use of the male pronoun in its theoretical publica - tions. <note type="researchNote">This despite their publication of and apparent endorsement of Carolee Schneemann's "The Prounoun Tyranny" in the Fox, 3(1976)</note></p>
			<p> Experiences like this one and dissatisfaction with Marxism's lack of interest in
				"the woman question" make me wary of merging Marxism and feminism. The notion of the
				non-economic or "vertical" class is anathema to Marxists and confusion is rampant
				around the chicken-egg question of whether women can be equal be - fore the
				establishment of a classless society or whether a classless society can be
				established before women are liberated. As Sheila Row - botham says of her own
				Marxism and feminism: <quote>They are at once incompatible and in real need of one
					another. As a feminist and a Marxist I carry their contradictions within me and
					it is tempting to opt for one or the other in an effort to produce a tidy
					resolution of the commotion generated by the antagonism between them. But to do
					that would mean evading the social reality which gives rise to the antagonism. <note type="researchNote">Sheila Rowbotham, Women: Resistance and Revolution (London, 1972).</note></quote></p>
			<p>As women, therefore, we need to establish far more strongly our own sense of
				community, so that all our arts will be enjoyed by all women in all economic
				circumstances. This will happen only when women artists make conscious ef - forts to
				cross class barriers, to consider their audience, to see, respect, work with the
				women who create outside the art world-whether in suburban crafts guilds or in
				offices and factories or in community workshops. The current femi - nist passion for
				women's traditional arts, which influences a great many women artists, should make
				this road much easier, undess it too be - comes another commercialized rip-off.
				Despite the very real class obstacles, I feel strongly that women are in a
				privileged position to satisfy the goal of an art which would communicate the needs
				of all classes and sexes to each other, and get rid ofthe we/they dichotomy to as
				great an extent as is possible in a capitalist framework. Our sex, our oppression
				and our female experi- ence-our female culture, just being explored - offer access
				to all of us by these common threads.</p>
