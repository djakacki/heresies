				this november
				city is up
				tight. in midtown
				the ibm selectrics
				have been bolted
				to the desks
				of secretaries
				who are afraid, now
				to change jobs.
				the druggists refuse
				to fill medicaid
				prescriptions.
				a man has been shot
				for going
				over the turnstiles.
				we slept overnight
				on long island,
				all the way out.
				i saw each grain
				of sand a different
				color, stuffed shells
				in my coat. i walked
				as before toward rain
				down a beach shining
				white through the storm,
				watched the tide
				turn once.
				locked into the city,
				i plan to quit my job.
				i must get a jacket
				with a working
				zipper, call
				the exterminator,
				have a gate installed
				on the fire escape
				access window.

				Dead in Bloody Snow
				Meridel LeSueur
			</p>
         <p>
				I am an Indian woman
				Witness to my earth
				Witness for my people.
				I am the nocturnal door,
				The hidden cave of your sorrow,
				Like you hidden deep in furrow
				and dung
				of the charnel mound,
				I heard the craven passing of the
				white soldiers
				And saw them shoot at Wounded Knee
				upon the sleeping village,
				And ran with the guns at my back
				Until we froze in our blood on the snow
				I speak from old portages
				Where they pursued and shot into the river crossing
				All the grandmothers of Black Hawk.
				I speak from the smoke of grief,
				from the broken stone,
				And cry with the women crying from the marsh
				Trail and tears of drouthed women,
				O bitter barren!
				O barren bitter!
				I run, homeless.
				I arrive
				in the gun sight,
				beside the white square houses
				of abundance.
				My people starve
				In the time of the bitter moon.
				I hear my ghostly people crying
				A hey a hey a hey.
				Rising from our dusty dead the sweet grass,
				The skull marking the place of loss and flight.
				I sing holding my severed head,
				to my dismembered child,
				A people's dream that died in bloody snow.

				Meridel LeSueur defines herself as "a 76-year-old Mid¬
				western writer," something of an understatement since she
				has published 12 books and innumerable stories, articles
				and poems. "Dead in Bloody Snow" is reprinted from Rites
				of Ancient Ripening (Vanilla Press, Minneapolis, 1975) in
				which she says, "Slogan for 76: Survival is a form of resis¬
				tance
