            <p>Four score and seven years ago <orgName>our fathers</orgName> brought forth on this continent, a new
               <orgName>nation</orgName>, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are
               created equal. </p>
            <p> Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that <orgName>nation</orgName>, or any nation
               so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a <placeName>great battle-field</placeName> of
               that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that <placeName>field</placeName>, as a final resting place
               for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It is altogether
               fitting and proper that we should do this. </p>
            <p> But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not
               hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have
               consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little
               note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here.
               It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which
               they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is rather for us to be here
               dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we
               take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of
               devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain
               -- that this nation, under <placeName>God</placeName>, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that
               government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the
               earth. </p>
