				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>In putting together this issue on The Great Goddess/Women’s Spirituality, we wanted to offer a holistic
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>concept of the Goddess and to move beyond an inside/outside duality. We also recognized a need to counter
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the distrust that most women harbor towards religion and any aspect of spirituality because of the oppression
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>that we have all experienced from patriarchal religions.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>During the year that we have been working together, our collective process has passed through several
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>phases. In the beginning we had meetings attended by 30 or more women, which required us to separate into
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>committees. The committee division continued to evolve and resulted in three main editorial groupings:
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Personal/Ritual/Poetry/Fiction; Archaeological/Historical/Political/Theological; and Visual, which selected
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>material for submission to the full collective. Initially we attempted to create a review system so that everyone
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>could have an opportunity to see all submissions. However, some material could not be easily duplicated and
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>few people made the independent effort to look through the material from other committees. Because we were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>committed to the concept of total collective energy and process, we held a marathon weekend on a Long Island
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>farm where more than 30 women met in a communal atmosphere to review and make recommendations about
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>submissions. Over the next four months the full collective continued to make selections and often reviewed
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>rejected material. Committees were engaged in editing, shortening long articles to fit within space limitations,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>retyping, phoning and corresponding with contributors and soliciting material. During this intense period,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>members often had to attend three and four meetings a week. Our numbers dwindled to about 20
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>In the next phase we reviewed the editing of accepted pieces and began layout and design of the magazine.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Because we were far behind schedule, a number of women who had worked hard were no longer able to give
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>priority to their involvement in the collective. Also only a few women were willing to become heavily involved
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>in production work. Some women pitched in; some women hung in; some women checked in. But, again,
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>throughout this phase all decisions were open to the full collective at specially arranged meetings. We felt that
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>we had to make an effort to respect the contributions of all without assessing participation. We did not want to
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>regard decision-making as a power
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>There was often muted and, occasionally, dramatic conflict. In a smaller group, confrontation and its
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>resolution would have had to be more directly resolved, but the size of our group permitted distancing and an
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>evasion of differences that sometimes left individuals antagonistically engaged or estranged. A basic source of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>contention was our disparate definitions of the Goddess. Nor did we find an honest way to handle the implicit
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>and often explicit coercion involved in submitting our own work. Egotism about individual creations and their
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>significance/prominence flared. Our own inefficiency and ineptitude wearied us. The work was not equally
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>shared, although the decision process was. Decision-making in so large a group was extremely slow. Our original
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>committee division aroused factionalism. Members of committees felt that their subject matter was not being
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>fully respected by members of other committees and defensive attitudes developed. However, our slowness may
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>have achieved a greater fairness and even our factionalism may have clarified viewpoints that otherwise would
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>have been blunted by the consensus-voting process, and right to this moment, we have continued to challenge
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ourselves by seeking collective consensus on an infinitude of decisions. We feel that we tested the collective
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>process and that that process not only produces the most representative work but also withstands the greatest
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>stresses. Although our sharing must include the knowledge of how we were often divided against ourselves
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>there were also many good times when we shared a heightened regard for each other, when we felt that we were
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>touched by the Goddess.
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>From the Heresies Collective
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>HERESIES is an idea-oriented journal devoted to the examination of art and politics from a feminist perspective. We believe that what
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>is commonly called art can have a political impact, and that in the making of art and of all cultural artifacts our identities as women play a
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>distinct role. We hope that HERESIES will stimulate dialogue around radical political and aesthetic theory, encourage the writing of the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>history of femina sapiens, and generate new creative energies among women. It will be a place where diversity can be articulated. We are
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>committed to the broadening of the definition and function of art
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>HERESIES is structured as a collective of feminists, some of whom are also socialists, marxists, lesbian feminists or anarchists; oun
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>fields include painting, sculpture, writing, anthropology, literature, performance, art history, architecture and filmmaking. While the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>themes of the individual issues will be determined by the collective, each issue will have a different editorial staff made up of women who
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>want to work on that issue as well as members of the collective. Proposals for issues may be conceived and presented to the HERESIES
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>Collective by groups of women not associated with the collective. Each issue will take a different visual form, chosen by the group re
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>sponsible. HERESlES will try to be accountable to and in touch with the international feminist community. An open evaluation meeting
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>will be held after the appearance of each issue. Topics for issues will be announced well in advance in order to collect material trom many
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>sources. Possibly satellite pamphlets and broadsides will be produced continuing the discussion of each central theme. As part of its
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>commitment to the women’s community, HERESIES provides workshops in all phases of magazine production and maintains the Women
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>Artists’ Slide Registry
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>As women, we are aware that historically the connections between our lives, our arts and our ideas have been suppressed. Once these
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>connections are clarified they can function as a means to dissolve the alienation between artist and audience, and to understand the
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>relationships between art and politics, work and workers. As a step toward a demystification of art, we reject the standard relationship of
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_69' n='N069'/>criticism to art within the present system, which has often become the relationship of advertiser to product. We will not advertise a new set
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_70' n='N070'/>of genius-products just because they are made by women. We are not committed to any particular style or aesthetic, nor to the competi
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_71' n='N071'/>tive mentality that pervades the art world. Our view of feminism is one of process and change, and we feel that in the process of dialogue
				<lb facs='#facs_2_r_1_1_tl_72' n='N072'/>we can foster a change in the meaning of art.

				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>it may be helpful to clarify at least three emerging
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>aspects of this relatively new phenomenon. These
				<lb facs='#facs_4_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>three aspects, of what may be the most unexpected

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>To answer these questions, we must first understand
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the importance of religious symbols and rituals in human
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>life. According to anthropologist Clifford Geertz religious
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>symbols shape a cultural ethos, defining the deepest
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>values of a society and the persons in it. “Religion,
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Geertz writes, &quot;is a system of symbols which act to pro
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>duce powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>motivations”“ in the people of a given culture. A &quot;mood
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>for Geertz is a psychological attitude such as awe, trust or
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>respect, while a “motivation” is the social and political
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>trajectory created by a mood which transforms mythos
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>into ethos, symbol system into social and political reality.
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Symbols have both psychological and political effects be
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>cause they create the inner conditions (deep-seated at
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>titudes and féelings) which lead people to feel com
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>fortable with or to accept social and political arrange
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>ments that correspond to the symbol system. Because
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>religion has such a compelling hold on the deep psyches
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>of so many people, feminists cannot afford to leave it in
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>the hands of the fathers. Even people who no longer &quot;be

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>of patriarchal religion still may not be free of the power of
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the symbolism of God the Father. A symbol’s effect is not
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>dependent on rational assent, for a symbol also functions
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>on levels of the psyche other than the rational. Religion

				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>riage, death). Even people who consider themselves com
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>pletely secularized will often find themselves sitting in a
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>church or synagogue when a friend or relative gets mar
				<lb facs='#facs_10_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>ried, or when a parent or friend dies. The symbols associ

				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>of traditions but their attitudes toward these traditions are
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>eclectic and selective. Ancient traditions are filtered
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>through modern experience and there is no sense that
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>every aspect of ancient or culturally distant religious con
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>sciousness must be adopted as whole cloth.
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>At the simplest and most basic level, the symbol of
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Goddess is an acknowledgment of the legitimacy of fe
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>male power as a beneficent and independent power. A
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>woman who echoes Ntosake Shange’s dramatic state
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>ment, &quot;I found God in myself and 1 loved her fiercely, is
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>saying, &quot;Female power is strong and creative.” She is say
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing that the divine principle, the saving and sustaining
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>power, is in herselt, that she will no longer look to men or
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>male figures as saviors. This meaning of the symbol of
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Goddess is simple and obvious, and yet it is difficult for
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>many to comprehend. It stands in sharp contrast to the
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>paradigms of female dependence on males which have
				<lb facs='#facs_11_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>been predominant in our culture. The internationally ac

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>definitely not “out there,” that the symbol of a divinity
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>&quot;out there” is part of the legacy of patriarchal oppression,
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>which brings with it the authoritarianism, hierarchicalism

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>nature, suggesting the connectedness between women&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>and death cycles of the universe. Others seem quite com
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>fortable with the notion of Goddess as a divine female
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>protector and creator and would find their experience of

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>women were positively valued. But as Western religions
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>entered into a state of alienation from the body, nature
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and this world, women were denigrated because they
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>seemed more carnal, fleshy and earthy than the culture
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>creating males.12 The misogynist anti-body tradition in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Western thought is symbolized in the myth of Eve who is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>traditionally viewed as a sexual temptress, the epitome of
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>women’s carnal nature. This tradition reaches its nadir in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>the Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of Evil-Doing
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Women) which states, “All witchcraft stems from carna
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>lust which in women is insatiable.&quot;1
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>The denigration of the female body is also expressed in
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>the taboos of our culture that surround menstruation and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>childbirth. While menstruation taboos may have originat

				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>body,”4 they have degenerated into a simple perception
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>that something is “wrong” with female bodily functions
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Menstruation is viewed as a curse, and women grow up
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>believing that the bloody facts of menstruation are best
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>hidden. Judy Chicago’s Menstruation Bathroom broke
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>these taboos. In a sterile white bathroom she exhibited
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>boxes of tampons and Kotex on an open shelf, while the
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>wastepaper basket overflowed with bloody tampons and
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Kotex.15 Many women who saw the piece felt relieved to
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>have their &quot;dirty secret” out in the open.
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>The denigration of the female body and its powers is
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>further expressed in Western culture’s attitudes toward
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>childbirth. Civing birth is treated as a disease requiring
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>hospitalization and the woman is viewed as a passive ob
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ject, anesthetized to ensure her acquiescence to the will
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>of the doctor.16. The women’s liberation movement has
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>aided the advocates of natural childbirth and home birth
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>by emphasizing the need for women to control and take
				<lb facs='#facs_12_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>pride in their bodies.

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>modern women to learn that many of the ancient Goddess
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>figures were painted with red ochre between the legs, the

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>power.&quot;7. The Goddess is often depicted in the act of giv

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>the life-giving powers of the universe.18 The possibilities

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>by Barbry MyOwn and Hallie Mountainwing. In this ritual

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>together. Finally, they marked each other’s faces with rich

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>nificance for men and all beings. The denigration of the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>body and the spirit/flesh, mind/body split has been in
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>jurious to men too. The denigration of the body and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>nature has also contributed to our current ecological crisis
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>because nature has been viewed simply as material for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>human consumption. Thus, the Goddess as symbol of the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>revaluation of body and nature can pull together many of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>the themes addressed separately in the human potential
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and ecology movements. In this case the mood is one of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>affirmation, awe and respect for the body and nature and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>the motivation is to respect the teaching of the body and

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>A third important implication of the symbol of God
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>dess for women is the positive valuation of will in a Cod
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>dess-centered framework. Here 1 am not referring to the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>symbol of Goddess in general, but specifically to the no
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>tion of will in Goddess-centered ritual magic and spell
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>casting. The basic notion behind ritual magic and spell
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>casting is energy as power. The Goddess is a center or
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>focus of power and energy; She is the personification of
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the energy which flows between beings in the natural and
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>human worlds. According to Starhawk, “witches conceive
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>of psychic energy as having form and substance that can
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>be perceived and directed by those with a trained aware
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ness. The power generated within the circle is built into a
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>cone form, and at its peak is released—to the Goddess, to
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>reenergize the members of the coven, or to do a specific
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>work such as healing.&quot;20 In ritual magic, energy is direct

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>cause women traditionally have been taught to devalue
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>their wills, to believe that they cannot achieve their will
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>through their own power and even to suspect that the as
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sertion of will is evil. Faith Wilding&apos;s poem &quot;Waiting

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>their own will, but by waiting for others to take the in

				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Patriarchal religion has enforced the view that female
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>initiative and will are evil through the juxtaposition of Eve
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>and Mary. Eve caused the fall by asserting her will over
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>and against the command of God, while Mary began the
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>new age with her response to God’s initiative, “Let it be
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>done to me according to thy word” (Luke 1:38). Even for
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>men, patriarchal religions value the passive will. The
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>classical doctrines of sin and grace view sin as the prideful
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>assertion of will and grace as the obedient subordiatnion
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>of human will (female or male) to the divine initiative or
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>order. Although this view of will might be questioned
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>from a human perspective, Valerie Saiving Goldstein has
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>argued that it has particularly deleterious consequences
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>for women in Western culture. According to Goldstein,
				<lb facs='#facs_13_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>secular Western culture encourages males in the assertion
			</p>
			<pb n='14'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>of will; thus in practice we may find that the male form of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>sin is an excess of will. But since culture discourages fe
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>males in the assertion of will, the traditional doctrines of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sin and grace encourage women to remain in their form of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sin, which is self-negation or insufficient assertion of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>will.22 One possible reason for the denigration of will in a
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>patriarchal religious framework is that both human and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>divine will are often pictured as arbitrary, self-initiatec
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>and exercised without regard for other wills.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>In a Goddess-centered context, in contrast, the will is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>valued. A woman is encouraged to know her will, to be
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>lieve that her will is valid and to believe that her will can
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>be achieved in the world—three sources of strength and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>motivation to take direct action, sources traditionally
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>denied to her in patriarchy. In a Goddess-centered frame
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>work a woman’s will is not subordinated to the Lord God
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>as King and Ruler, nor to men as His representatives. Thus
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>a woman is not reduced to waiting for and acquiescing to
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the will of others as she is in patriarchy. But neither does
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>she adopt the egocentric form of will that pursues self
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>interest without regard for the interests of others
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The Goddess-centered context provides a different un
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>derstanding of will than that available in the traditiona
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>patriarchal religious framework. In the Goddess frame
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>work, will can be achieved only when it is exercised in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>harmony with the energies and wills of other beings. Wise
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>women, for example, raise a cone of healing energy at the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>full moon or solstice when the lunar or solar energies are
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>at their high points with respect to the earth. This dis
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>cipline encourages them to recognize that not all times
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>are propitious for the achieving of every will. Similarly
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>they know that spring is a time for new beginnings in work
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and love; summer, a time for producing external man
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>ifestations of inner potentialities; and fall or winter, times
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>for stripping down to the inner core and for extending
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>roots. Such awareness of waxing and waning processes in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>the universe discourages the arbitrary ego-centered asser
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>tion of will, while at the same time encouraging the as
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>sertion of individual will in cooperation with natural
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>energies and the energies created by the wills of others.
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Wise women also have a traditional belief that whatever is
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sent out will be returned, and this reminds them to assert
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>their wills in cooperative and healing ways rather than in
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>egocentric and destructive ones. This view of will allows
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>women to begin to recognize, claim and assert their will:
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>without adopting the undesirable characteristics of the
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>patriarchal understanding and use of will. This is not,
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>however, to imply that women invariably exercise their

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>In patriarchal literature and psychology, the relation

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>or even mentioned. As de Beauvoir has noted, the mother
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>daughter relationship is distorted in our male-defined
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>culture because the mother (perhaps subconsciously) be
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>lieves her role is to prepare her daughter to enter into that

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>inferior.25 The mother socializes her daughter to become
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>subordinate to men, and if the daughter challenges patri
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>archal norms, the mother is likely to defend the patri

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>en’s heritage. In one of her finest songs she writes of an

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>an feels for the life that has passed the old woman by and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>begins to cry, but the old woman looks her in the eye and
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>says, &quot;Ifl had not suffered, you wouldn’t be wearing those
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>jeans/ Being an old time woman ain’t as bad as it seems.&quot;2e
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>This song expresses and celebrates a bond and a heritage
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>passed down from one woman to another. In another of
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Near’s songs, she sings of &quot;a hiking boot mother who&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>girl.&quot; In this song, the mother tells the drifter who has

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>is the myth of the Goddess Demeter and her daughter
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Persephone. This story was told, possibly enacted, in con
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>nection with the religious rites of the Thesmophoria
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>which were for women only, and the Eleusinian Mysteries
				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>of Greece. In this story Persephone is abducted by the

				<lb facs='#facs_14_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>daughter and for her relationship to her daughter. This is a

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>are stubbornly and irrationally opposed to the develop

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>My personal religious beliefs underwent a cataclysmic
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>change during adolescence, when overnight I emerged
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>from an intensely religious period into what has remained

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ophy to sustain me through life. During my childhood and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>adolescence, I deeply experienced the damage done by
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the prevalent attitudes towards females. Perhaps for this
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>reason, 1finally found a possible answer in feminism.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Of all my experiences, the most fulfilling sense of unity
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>and of purpose and belief, within myself and within rela
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>tionships, has come from reading feminist literature

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>and occasionally celebrating with my sisters. Neverthe

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>my reading progressed to a number of books, which have
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>appeared in recent years, describing the matriarchal cul

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>began to understand why

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>a society where people worshipped a female deity and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>where women held positions of power and responsibility.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>What would it feel like to pray to God the Mother? To sing
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>paeans of praise to Her glory? As l experimented, in spite
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>of my essential agnosticism, 1 found myself feeling a great
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>sense of peace in the mere act of praying to a loving,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>female God. The experience was light-years away from

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>signed to hell by a punitive male god. I also felt deep
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>anguish to know that such religions had existed thousands
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>of years ago, only to have been ruthlessly destroyed by
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>barbaric patriarchal invaders.

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>vided the stimulus to goad me into action. Mormons,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Baptists and various fundamentalist religious groups were
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>there in force, joined with the American Nazi Party, John
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Birch Society and Ku Klux Klan to try to subvert the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>conference. When they began singing hymns, 1 sang along
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>but with one major difference: I changed the hymns to
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Hers. When they sang, &quot;He’s got the whole world in his
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>hands,&quot; l happily warbled, &quot;She’s got the whole world..
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>When the conference closed with a recitation of the
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>Lord’s Prayer, 1 joyfully intoned, “Our Mother who art in
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>heaven...&quot; And when I returned home after the con
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>ference was over, 1 sent my granddaughter a new version
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of Jesus Loves Me, which is:
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Isis loves me, this I know
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Mother God has told me so.

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Our Lady told me so.

				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>September. In preparation for this conference 1 began to
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>think through some of the ideas that had been taking form
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>in my mind.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The sum total of my experiences led me to realize that
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>lack of faith in an organized religion had left a hole in my
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>life which no amount of rational, philosophical specula
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>tions about the meaning of it all can fill. The fact is
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>enjoy the rituals, symbols, songs, processions, ceremonies
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>—the full panoply of organized religion. I like to wear
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>clothing and jewelry that express my commitment to and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>faith in my beliefs. I enjoy singing along with people,
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>joining hands, performing rites and acts that physically
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>demonstrate and symbolize my emotional, spiritual and
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>philosophical self—my deepest being. But 1 also realize
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>that I am quite incapable of participating in such rituals
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>while being totally opposed to the doctrines they rep
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>resent. There is no way 1 can take part in a religion that
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>preaches the subjugation of women.
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>The answer to this dilemma then became so obvious
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>that I am shocked not to have found it sooner. I believe
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the answer is to reinstate a feminist religion that can fulfill
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>the human need for religious rituals at the same time that
				<lb facs='#facs_18_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>it celebrates our feminist faith in the ultimate good of

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>being female and invokes the Mother-God-given right of

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>in all aspects of life.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Such a religion would provide opportunities for women
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to meet together to take part in ceremonies and to reaf
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>firm our faith in our feminist beliefs. This spiritual and
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>emotional renewal would strengthen the bonds among us.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Besides providing spiritual sustenance, the feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>religion could be a powerful tool in our fight for equal
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>rights. In spite of the supposed Constitutional separation
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of church and state, the fact is that our legal codes are
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>based on patriarchal religious dogmas and customs. The
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>frequency with which opponents of the Equal Rights
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>Amendment and other feminist issues quote the Bible to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>justify their opposition is evidence enough of the use of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>religion for political purposes. The doctrine of an or
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ganized religion that propounds feminist values as the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>direct reflection of Divine Intention is the ultimate answer
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>to those who argue that a male god has decreed other

				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>rights.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>The NOW conference workshop offered the opportu
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>nity to explain these feelings and experiences to other
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>women and to propose that we establish our own feminist
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>religion. I also offered a few specific suggestions that
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>seemed positive. First, that the religion be as undogmatic
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and non-authoritarian as possible to best serve as a ve
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>hicle for expressing the thoughts, feelings, needs and
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>desires of all of us. Second, that care must be exercised to
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>avoid forming the usual hierarchy of clergy as separate
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>from congregation and to assure maximum participation
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of everyone concerned in formulating and carrying out
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the doctrines and rituals of a feminist religion.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>do, however, believe that a formal women’s religious
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>organization would be economically advantageous in that
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>it would enable us to have access to the tax benefits
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>allowed to other religious groups. These benefits could
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>help to cover the cost of clinics, publications, learning
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>centers and many other aspects of the women’s move
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>ment
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>In addition to these considerations, there is one fun
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>damental principle that 1 feel must be basic to our religion
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>if it is to express feminist beliefs. This is the divine right of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>every child to be born to a mother who wants it, which in
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>turn would assure every woman the right to control her
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>own body and to bear children only when and if she
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>wholeheartedly wants to do so. 1 feel that the act of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>exercising this control, whether by means of birth control,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>abortion or abstention, should be considered to be in
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>total accord with our belief in &quot;divine intention.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>would also like to see the physical fact of being
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>female sanctified and celebrated. Since the aura of guilt
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>and disgust surrounding female physiology promulgated
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>by a misogynistic patriarchy is so destructive and damag
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>ing to women’s emotional and physical well-being,
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>would like to see this attitude replaced by feelings of joy
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>and self-affirmation in the inherent good of being female.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>Generally, 1 would like our feminist religion to be
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>positive, joyous and free of fear. Rather than teaching the
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>dogma of original sin, we could proclaim the fact of
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>original good. I would prefer a list of “Thou shalts” rather
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>than &quot;Thou shalt nots&quot; and a philosophy of rewards for
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>doing good rather than punishments for doing wrong.
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>would like our religion to affirm the intrinsic good of all
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>expressions of love between humans, regardless of sex or
				<lb facs='#facs_19_r_1_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>of other artificial restrictions imposed by a patriarchal

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>... Einstein and other well-known physicists have noted the

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>chromosome, as everyone knows, is Y. Male energy is short

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Nowhere is the short-circuiting of the male more obvious

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>have traditionally proscribed the rising snake of sexual ener

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Male religions have coopted the female principality in
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>many ways. For example, Yin and Yang are recent male in
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ventions intended to give men a place in spiritual life, just
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>as the acknowledgment of sexual reproduction gave them a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>role in family life. The comparison is revealing for, although
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>concepts such as Yin and Yang appear to posit equality,
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>men have taken for themselves superior spiritual roles, just
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>as they have claimed supreme authority in the family, even
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>though their role in reproduction is clearly secondary.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>The allocation of Yin, or passivity, to women is merely
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the most obvious part of the ruse. As every woman with a
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>raised consciousness knows, women need not choose be
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>tween activity and passivity. Women are capable of being
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>both active and passive. It may even be said that in this re
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>spect women are balanced, whereas men are imbalanced—
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>overly &quot;active.
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>More important, the algebraic X signifies the unknown
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and is also the Greek letter psi as in psychic. X represents
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>negative energy, the energy that dissolves the material world
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>as in the X-ray process. Women (XX) actually transmit more
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>negative (dematerializing), so-called passive energy than
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>men (XY) do and can thus experience states of passivity (spir

				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Originally the Yin-Yang symbol represented this essentia
				<lb facs='#facs_48_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>eveness or Eve-ness. To perceive this inner meaning, one

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>constitutes a natural Mikva: lake, river, sea.

				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>collected through the force of gravity, usually rainwater. The rainwater is gathered
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>into a huge container called the &quot;bor” or pit. a building is constructed around this
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>bor. The building contains small individual sunken pools for private immersion. Each
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>pool shares a wall with the bor. Each shared wall has a hole cut in it which can be
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>plugged up or left open. In order to make the adjoining pools into legally valid
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>Makvaot, they are &quot;seeded&quot; with bor water and then filled with regular heated tap
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>water. When the hole between this pool and the bor is unplugged so that the waters
				<lb facs='#facs_54_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>are touching (or, as the sources put it, &quot;kissing”), the pool becomes a valid Mikva.

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. For twenty years.

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>man. A Roman Catholic communist.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>His habits were immaculate. He kept his present
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>three-room domicile as clean as a monk’s cell. And
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>he was especially devoted to the Blessed Virgin.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>As way of example of his extreme moral impec
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>cability, after his dear wife had passed on, he had
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>begun masturbating. In the beginning, remembering
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>those early days of connubial bliss, he had used
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>those blessed memories with which to stimulate his
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>hypothalamus. But, as time went on, he caught him
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>self phantasizing a face, which although it seemed
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>familiar, still eluded him.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Some female visitor to the Gallery, no doubt. Yet
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the face was so transportive, so ideal, that he racked
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>his brain upon awakening to fullfillment in order to
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>trace his now steady, if only, imaginary lover.
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Imagine his shock, and self-disgust, upon coming
				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to an early shift, at 4:00 a.m., and noticing that the

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Herself. At this discovery, Muscarotti fell to his

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Fortunately, no one saw him. By the time his

				<lb facs='#facs_58_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>&quot;The best way to describe this to you — is this.

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>as their emblem. In the Delian hymn sung at her altar, she is
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>Eileithyia Eulinos (&quot;with the goodly thread&quot;), a goddess of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>destiny whose sacred emblem is the cord. She is a magician
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>and sorceress who when she held her knees together
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>clasped her hands with crossed fingers and muttered charms
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>could postpone labor at will. The images in her many
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>shrines always showed her veiled, and in places &quot;she was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>regarded with such sanctity that only her priestesses were
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>permitted to see herimage.&quot;3
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>To be veiled means &quot;to weave,” from the same Anglo

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>a sacred action. In all the actions, the goddess is the Maya,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>the greatweaver of life.&quot;36 The Indian concept of the woven
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>veil of Maya, or Illusion, is undoubtedly related to the idea
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of woman as the eternal weaver of webs. At Catal Huyuk, a

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>some five thousand years later (c. 1000 B.c.). Isis, the great
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>enchantress, is veiled; so too Neith, who
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>&quot;was the personification of the eternal female principle of
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>life which was self-sustaining and self-existent, and was
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>secret, and unknown, and all-pervading. .. the prototype of

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Penelope (&quot;with a web over her face”) eluded her many
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>suitors by secretly unravelling at night the weaving she had
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>done by day. In ancient China, where the female Weaver
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>was a stellar divinity, a bride was required to be veiled dur
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>ing the marriage celebrations and rites of betrothal and mar
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>riage took place only in the hours of twilight.
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>The aura of mystery that surrounds the riddle may be

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>represented as a hybrid animal with female head and breasts,
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>is a symbol of this hidden wisdom. The riddle she posed to
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the inhabitants of Thebes was in the nature of a highly sacred
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>initiatory ordeal and all who failed to unravel her mysteries
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>were strangled on the spot. When Oedipus solved the enig

				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>literature and myth document that the revelations of the
				<lb facs='#facs_70_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Delphic Oracle were couched in enigmatic form. The Cor

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>that they did not make. This is a matter of metaphysics,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>whether we like that term or not, and it is necessary to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>consider yet another distinction that derives from oun
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>European western metaphysics—one that is alien to
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Anasazi belief. We assume a distinction between &quot;living
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>things, such as animals and plants, and &quot;non-living” ones,
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>such as rocks and water. The distinction did not exist for
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the early Anasazi people and still does not exist for many
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>of their present-day descendants. For the Anasazi/Hopi

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tually interconnected parts of a living Whole. Earth is

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>beings scurrying around on top. Mother Earth is a living

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>because no such things exist. Atoms are alive, energizec

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Once we can view the world without separating the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>animate from the inanimate, we can better understand

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>possibility for what we call psychic phenomena. For the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>Anasazi, thought was not a mere epiphenomenon of a few
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>pounds of cerebral cortex but was in itself a vital, viable
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>powerful force that could and did affect things in the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>world, such as the weather and other natural forces. Our
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>own orientation confuses us when we try to understand
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>this because as soon as we say &quot;affect things,” we assume
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>a linear version of cause and effect. The Anasazi held a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>more complex concept of reality. Since they regarded all
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>things as related to each other, cause and effect were not
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>a simple matter of a one-two chain reaction, but rather a
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>complex interrelationship, a network, a pattern in which
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>they perceived cycles as well as lines, and subtle as well

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>ruins in Chaco Canyon, New Mexico that were built be
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>tween 1000 and 1200 A.D. Some of the more extensive
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>pueblos span about three acres. In some cases pueblos are
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>built on top of even older ruins, which had been aban
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>doned by earlier generations of Anasazi. The ceremonial
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>temples, called kivas, were dug out of the earth, so that
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>they are wholly or partially subterranean. The kiva illus

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>used by a group of about 1000 people. Smaller kivas were
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>also at least partially underground and usually circular
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Each kiva contained a sipapu, a circular hole dug out of
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the floor. The sipapu symbolized the place of emergence
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>from the last world
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Kivas were a part of the daily life of the Anasazi, as
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>were their spiritual practices. They were used constantly
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>for ceremonial preparations and rituals.2 For the architects
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>of these buildings, there was no distinction between the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>spiritual and the political, i.e., between their religious and
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>secular lives—or for that matter between art and non-art
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Religion and art were an integral part of daily life. The
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Anasazi’s ritual ceremonies celebrated life and their daily
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>lives celebrated the beauty of a total reality, naturally in

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>The Anasazi ceremonies were held either inside the

				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>framed by these concentric, step-like buildings. As Vin
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>cent Scully says, &quot;Most of the dances of ritual ...are
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>held, now as in the recorded past, tight up against the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>buildings. .. And the beat of those dances is built into the
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>architecture, which thus dances too.&quot;3
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>The architecture’s very structure expressed the meta
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>physical belief in the interdependence and interconnect
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>edness of all things in a dynamic Whole. The pueblo was
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>composed of interconnected cells, so that it was quite
				<lb facs='#facs_92_r_4_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>typical for one unit’s south wall to be the next unit’s north

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>ing the egalitarian social belief of the Anasazi. Each of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>these cellular units was owned by a woman. The Anasazi
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>were matrilineal and matrilocal. When a daughter mar
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>ried, a unit was built adjacent to that of her mother anc
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>she and her husband moved in. (In case of divorce, the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>man moved out, leaving the woman in a relatively more
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>secure position, since she had the house and the suppori
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>of her own clan.) The layout of the Anasazi pueblo was a
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>direct result of this matrilocal arrangement: Constructior

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>growth pattern: &quot;Reproduction in this organically con
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>ceived society is ideally by means of budding. As the Hop
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>matrilineal clan grows by adding daughter households to
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the mother unit, so the pueblo expands by the budding of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>daughter colonies from the original nucleus. Thus ideally
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>the society is able to augment and completely recon
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>stitute itself.&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>This budding type of growth pattern is different from
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>that of our architecture. For us, the basic structural unit is
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the building to which new rooms, patios, etc., can be
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>added. Pueblo architecture’s basic structural unit is the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>room itself, and growth consists of indefinite repetition of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>this basic unit. Although J.B. Jackson seems to consider
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>this growth pattern inferior to our more “complex” way of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>building, he points out that it seems to imply “the belies
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>in the cumulative power of infinite repetition.”» This be
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>liet is also reflected in the Chaco Canyon masonry, which
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>prefers small stones to large ones. Jackson says, &quot;It is as i
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the builders were saying that a wall is sturdy when it is
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>made out of a multitude of identical small fragments.&quot;6
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>think it is likely that these builders, who were members of
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>a matrilineal, egalitarian society and who expressed thein

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Probably the most dramatic difference between Ana
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>sazi architecture and ours is the relationship of its forms
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to the earth. This difference is most marked in the struc
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>ture of the kivas. European influenced churches are
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>capped with phallic steeples, straining to leave the earth
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>to reach the male God in the sky; arches cleave walls well
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>above human height, pointing to the same exalted being
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>By total contrast, Anasazi architecture hugs Mother Earth,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and the most sacred is the lowest and most enveloped
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Kivas are dug out of the earth and are usually circular
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>reflecting earth’s form.” The most sacred part of the entire
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>pueblo, the sipapu, the place of emergence from the last
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>world, is dug deep into the already subterranean kiva.
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>This sacred orifice is protected by the circular kiva, whose

				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The concentric arrangement of the kivas may reflect
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>the matrifocused spiritual beliefs of the Anasazi. The
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>walls of some kivas are nearly two feet thick.? They are
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>made up of stones, mortar, layers of plaster and (some
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>times) paint. Frank C. Hibben reports that &quot;In some kivas
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>having many painted coats of plaster, the layers them
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>selves made up perhaps a third of the thickness of the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>walls.&quot;9 These concentric layers symbolically protect the
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>sipapu and the people inside the kiva. For the Anasazi,
				<lb facs='#facs_93_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>Hopi, two types of labyrinth symbolize Mother Earth a

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>The same symbolism seems to be the underlying mo
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>tive of the layout of the pueblo itself. There are two basic
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>kinds of ground plan apparent in the pueblos throughout
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>the Southwest that echo the two maze shapes. One is a
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>sort of semicircular or capital letter D shape (analogous to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>Figure 1); the other is a more rectangular, roughly E shape
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>—sometimes with the center bar missing (analogous to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Figure 2). All of the rooms on any one level of a pueblo
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>are connected by doorways, so that it is possible to enter
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>a room at one end and wind one’s way through the rooms
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>to the other end. The multiple rows of rooms arranged
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>around a central plaza create a concentric, centripetal
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>design. That this labyrinthine structure was intended to
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>symbolize Mother Earth is at least plausible; if it does, this
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>is another way in which the Anasazi expressed their spir

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>We have already discussed the intimate connection
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>between the Anasazi’s matrifocused society and the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>growth pattern of their architecture, and between the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>matrifocused spiritual beliefs and the structure of their
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>kivas, if not the entire pueblo complex. But it is even
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>more interesting to realize that this architecture was to a
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>great extent built by women. Apparently the division of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>labor was that the men cut and laid the timber (which
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>made the ceilings and partially framed the doors) and the
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>women built the walls. It is not common knowledge
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>among anthropologists that women were the major par
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>ticipants in building some of the most spectacular archi
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>tecture in North America.&quot;&quot; Not surprisingly, I came
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>across this bit of information in male literature, which
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>mentioned it in the process of denigrating women. The
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>following passage, written by George Kubler, was based
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>on the records of the seventeenth century Franciscan
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>missionary Benavides. The passage blames certain &quot;neg

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>at length because its ethnocentricity and phallocentricity
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>are so appallingly blatant as to be humorous (in an adren
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>alin-producing kind of way):

				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>in New Mexico during the missionary era. The arch is al
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>most nonexistent, and the dome is completely lacking, but
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>both forms may readily be built with the local materials.
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Why were they excluded from the architectural repertory of
				<lb facs='#facs_94_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the mission buildings? It is to be recalled that, to this day,

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>of indoctrination that is extremely difficult to combat. Be

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>literally stolen from their parents and forced to go to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>white man’s schools—far from their homes—where they
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>had to learn to speak in the English language and to think
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>in patriarchal concepts.14 This insidious form of oppres

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>Generations of indoctrination into the white man&apos;s

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>possible. Nearly 100 years ago, U.S. government agencies
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>began insidious efforts aimed at gaining control over Hop
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>land for mining purposes.15 However, the traditional Hopi
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>way of making decisions—by clan consensus, in which
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>every individual’s view counts equally and all must reach
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>agreement—was a constant impediment to deal-making
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>and sellouts. So the government instituted a Hopi Tribal
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Council, consisting of &quot;elected representatives. Those
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>sufficiently schooled in the white man’s ways agreed to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>vote for and support the Council. But traditional Hop
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>would not go along with this manipulation of tribal gov
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ernment. They boycotted the elections and refused to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>recognize the &quot;elected” officials as their representatives.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>The traditional Hopi still do not recognize the Tribal
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Council, but the U.S. government does. It was with this
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Tribal Council that the Department of Interior made its
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>contract to lease Hopi land to the Peabody Coal Company
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>for strip-mining. The Hopi Tribal Council stands to gain
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>more than $14 million over a 35-year period.16 In Hopi
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>land jobs are scarce, but they are available for those who

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>crucially important to the traditional Hopi is prophetic
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>visions. The Hopi have been guided by visions for count
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>less centuries. In fact, visions guided the people to Chaco
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Canyon after many hundreds of years of migration through
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>out North and South America.18 It is here that the Anazasi
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>built their earthen architecture and here that their de
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>scendants still choose to live.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>The white man’s appearance in Pueblo country was
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>prophesied long before he came. The prophesies predict
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ed that if the white man came bearing the sign of the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>circle, he would live in beneficial harmony with the Hopi
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>But if he came bearing the sign of the cross, he had lost
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>his true belief and would bring sickness and death with
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>him. The Anasazi women understood all too well the real
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>meaning of the cross crowning the missions that they were
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>forced to build.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The prophetic visions revealed that this new race of
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>people would be able to fly through the air and would
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>speak to each other through what appeared in the visions
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>to be &quot;cobwebs in the sky.&quot; The visions also foretold of a
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>road &quot;like a ribbon&quot; that would run through the Hopi
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>villages. Hopi men were later forced to build such a road
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>while working on chain gangs as punishment for resisting
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>government attempts to educate their children.
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Many of the prophesies have become realities, but
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>there are still more that pertain to the future. A crucial
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>prophecy, still unfolding, is that men will come to try to
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>take what lies under Hopi land. All of Mother Earth is
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>sacred to the Hopi. They believe that they live at the very
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>heart of this continent, the geomagnetic center—and that
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>tampering with Mother Earth at this sacred center will
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>create a serious imbalance. The prophecy warns that the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>people should not let the men take what is under their
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>land. For the Hopi who have been indoctrinated into the
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>white man’s world view, a view in which prophetic visions
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>are not valued, such a warning has little meaning. Yet
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>those who have managed to cling to their ancient world
				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>view and spiritual knowledge take the warning very

				<lb facs='#facs_95_r_4_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>as a political situation. The Hopi know it is a political

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>For some years I had been attempting to make
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>a pilgrimage to a Goddess site. I had been doing
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>private rituals in my art for some time, both out
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>doors in nature and in the studio. I could feed off
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>of them and hold them in my mind like totems.
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>but I was still hungry. I needed to do my rituals in
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>an actual prehistoric cave; to experience a Neo
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>lithic site where 1 could smell the earth, poke
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>around in the soil, breathe the air, and know that
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>the cave air had circulated through my body and
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>become a part of me. To go to a prehistoric site
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>became an obsession, and represented the place
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>to begin a new cycle. Numerous grants had not
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>materialized and the trip was long overdue. I sold
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>my car and bought the voyage.
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>Before leaving New York, 1 researched seven
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>sites in hopes of being able to locate and gain
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>access to at least one of them. (1 had been there
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>in my head many times.) My attraction to Yugo

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>gists, came from my wanting to start with a

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>worship and its art forms as well as to the later
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Goddess worshipping cultures. My fantasy and my
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>plans are to continue my pilgrimage in the coming
				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>years throughout the Mediterranean, to trace our

				<lb facs='#facs_98_r_7_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>Adriatic off the coast of Yugoslavia, 1 set out to

				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>proved to be word-of-mouth. In Jelsa, we (Anne
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>Healy and I were traveling together) tried to find
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>someone who spoke English and knew the where
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>abouts of the Grapceva spilja, chosen because it
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>appeared that I could be alone there. Little atten
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>tion had been paid to the site after its initial
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>excavation in 1955 by Professor Grya Novak.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>thought, from reading and intuition, that this cave
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>was probably used as a sanctuary by Neolithic
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>people.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The travel agent in Jelsa said flatly that no one
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>could tell us where the cave was, assuring us that
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>he had lived in the area all his life and had never
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>seen it. Obviously it was not worth bothering with.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Finally, we wangled out of him that a villager,
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>now retired, had led excursions by donkey up the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>steep mountain to the cave. The agent had trouble
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>remembering the guide’s name, but at last it came
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>out: &quot;Vicko.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>Vicko lived on a street behind a cafe in Jelsa.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>A second inquiry in town directed us there. &quot;Yell
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>his name and someone will point to his doorstep.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>This done, we were on the threshold of a house
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>where we were offered old world hospitality and
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>an abundance of homemade wine. Yes, he was
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>too old to go up the mountain, but his fourteen
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>year-old son knew the way
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>At daybreak the next morning we began the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>trip, climbing on and on while we and the heavy
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>camera gear baked in the intense sun. At the top
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>of the mountain, beyond the deserted village of
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>Humac, we began our descent to the barely acces
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>sible cave. The climb down was a series of straight
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>drops. What had once been a path was now acres
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>of mountain stone, obscuring the way to those
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>unfamiliar with it. Suddenly the blue Adriatic
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>stretched before us, and in the next moment, we
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>realized that we had reached the area around the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>cave. What an incredible location: the sea vista, a
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>shelf of flat rock extending from the front of the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>cave, fruit and nut trees and berry bushes on
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>either side. We could easily visualize the daily
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>activities of the Neolithic inhabitants gathered
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>there, talking, cooking, sunning.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Vicko’s son unlocked the gate placed over the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>mouth of the cave. I can think of our entrance
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>only in personal terms. It is very difficult to con
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>vey how thrilling this experience was to me. The
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>cave was dazzling. It was magnificent. The main
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>room, the great hall, sparkled and glistened with
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>coral quartz. Stalagmites and stalactites, suggest
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>ing great temple pillars, divided the rooms into
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>chambers. The atmosphere created a feeling of
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>reverence and awe. For me, it was a holy place.
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>Vicko’s son began to dig in the floor of the
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>cave and shortly produced some bones. As it
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>turned out, there were bones, shards and shells
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>everywhere. But the cave completely lacked light
				<lb facs='#facs_99_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>and the few candles we had did not begin to

			<pb n='100'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>penetrate the surrounding darkness. Although our
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>eyes could pick up a faint glimmer, a camera
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>could not record more than the light of the candle
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>itself. After resting, we headed down the mountain
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>to ask Vicko whether Anne and 1 could have the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>key to the gate to go back by ourselves the next
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>day.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>The following morning we set out with two
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>dozen candles and three Yugoslav flashlights. First,
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>wanted to explore the cave for myself. The low
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>contracted entrance to the cave opened into an
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>anteroom or anterior hall with a side chapel of the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>darkest and richest coral quartz imaginable. Lead
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing into the great hall, a vaulted ceiling with two
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>massive stalagmites, which had become pillars,
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>added to the majesty of the grotto. A dip in the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>middle of the hall—no doubt formed from cen
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>turies of use—was a natural center. To the left
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>side, chambers formed by smaller stalagmites
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>turned into narrow passages melting one into
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>another, curving downwards or upwards. Nature
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>had produced a complex labyrinth of sanctuaries.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Five &quot;lofts, which circled the back of the great
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>hall and extended into the chamber rooms about
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>five feet above the floor of the cave, were large
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>enough to sleep three or four people. The largest
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>caught my attention in particular because, unlike
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>the others, its floor and ceiling were jet black with
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>specks of mother-of-pearl imbedded in the surface.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Many of the pots recovered from the cave were
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>made from this black clay; others were made from
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>more traditional red clays.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>crawled into the space where, deep in one
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>corner, crouching to examine a broken area in the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>black floor, I found pure dark red clay, which was

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>could have been a kiln room. The clay, ready to

				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>in the same place, a perfect set-up. An indoor
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>kiln might have also driven out the dampness, the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>only aspect of the cave 1 found uncomfortable.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>Considering the surroundings, 1 began to revise my
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>notions of the hardships of primitive life—at least
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>in this location. The temperature and quality of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>the air, in spite of the heat outdoors, were far
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>superior to our air-conditioning. In one corner of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>the cave, a constant trickle of water provided a
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>natural water supply. Fruits, nuts and herbs were
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>at the doorstep, and the scent of lavender filled
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the air. The black crust of clay on the surface of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>the &quot;kiln&quot; loft wall was thin; scratching through
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>it I came to a bright white, and began to make the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>impresso patterns common to the area in Neo
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>lithic times. In a few strokes 1 felt one long hand
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>extending across time, sending a jolt of energy
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>into my body. I began my rituals.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>The energy from the rituals seemed to puslate
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>from the vaulted ceiling to me and back again.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Aware of the privilege of having the cave to
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>myself, 1 felt like the center of the universe. My
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>mouth was actually inhaling the cave, all of it,
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>and breathing it out again. The cave contracted
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>and expanded with my rhythms, and shimmered
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>on its way back and forth. I made a pact with the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>cave: it would tell me some of its secrets in ex
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>change for my rituals, rituals that it had not seen
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>for millennia. I in turn would learn some secrets
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>now and some later—l had only to listen, to keep
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>in touch.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The first stalagmite chamber to the front and
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>left of the great hall provided a natural altar, as it
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>was elevated a few feet above the floor and in
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>clear view from any point in the hall. In the center
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>of the altar stood a stalagmite the size of a large
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>Mother Goddess. Full-figured, she endured, frozen
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>through the ages but still in charge. In front of Her
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and facing the great hall was a sloping stalagmite
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>the height of a table; behind Her, concealed from
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>sight, a small chamber divided into threes: a
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>hidden sacristy.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>We poked around in the ground outside the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>cave, the sun warm on our backs. Anne said,&quot;
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>was in touch with myself today in a way that 1
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>have not been for a long time. On the way back
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>down, we spent time in the deserted village
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>abandoned, we guessed, for lack of water. But
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>here again was magic; on a back path we found a
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>pomegranate tree in full bloom. The vineyards
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>originally cultivated by Humac villagers are still
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>harvested for their grapes and the fields for their
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>lavender, which was in bloom. The houses, made
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>from fieldstones piled one on top of the other
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>without mortar, grew as if molded from the earth.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Everything was in harmony. We continued to
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>come down with our physical bodies, but our
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>spirits were still high up there.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Note: After this day, and with encouragement from the
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>natives of Hvar Island, we located Professor Novak. Again
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>by word of mouth, we found his house in the town of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Hvar. He graciously allowed us to visit his observatory,
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>which he showed us with pride, and the visit ended with
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>gifts of shards and shells from the cave. Among scores of
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>artifacts, mostly bowls, removed from the cave or recon
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>structed from shards, there were two chalices in Professor
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Novak’s observatory that were of particular interest to me.
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>Identically shaped, their form was so non-functional that
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>they must have been used for ritual purposes. They ap
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>peared to be very special; seeing them was like seeing
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>tangible proof of an ancient secret. I struggled to get a
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>photograph through the glass case. Chalices of this type
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>are referred to by Cimbutas as wine cups with phallus
				<lb facs='#facs_100_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>stem bases, used when the Coddess of Vegetation was

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>and it lands me inside my first memory. We’d gone to play
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>behind my Grandmother’s barn one evening, after a rain
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>A memory of sky in the puddles as a new-made rainbow

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>At this point, l’d like to report Her to the Patriarchy,

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>light. But She stamps out the pattern with feet of cut
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>glass. She makes Her tracks bloody with my own pain.

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>the dance her dying made, but couldn’t find her there. To
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>humor me, my collective said they’d bury me in the yard.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>How to come to terms with it? It crept into my conversa

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>And 1 did. Terror that laced us up in a web. She&apos;d heard a

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>highway. Her web filled with cuttings —blown in the
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>wind. The rope that She threw me held many hands— all
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>come to find our way home.

				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_4_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Waterpeople gathered together —for themselves and
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_4_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>for each other, people gathered around. The Goddess
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>went public —Kay Gardner dedicated her concert to my
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>getting well. Strangers were asked for prayers. I wandered
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>for weeks in time unremembered: I traveled through
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>words and came to my friends. The day the doctors said !
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>would die was the day 1 woke up.
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Not the same. I had changed. She blotted all from view
				<lb facs='#facs_102_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>but what She chose to show me, slowly so l’d learn. One

			<pb n='103'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>closer, all I could see was an eye. The world slipped under
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>a microscope. In for close study, life at the root. l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>forgotten how to choose between sounds. Everything
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>carried a life of its own. My left side blew in the wind, like
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>a leaf close to dying. All I remember is its being born. The
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>pain was so constant, it lost all its words. By the time
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>remember, thè first hurting was over, moving its way to
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>outside my skin. But someone must hold me or l would
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>fall. The path that I saw lay straight ahead. My neck didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>turn —1 couldn’t see ’round. No matter. Everyone loved
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>me. Persephone, once home, to go out no more
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>The fact that I didn’t feel winter was just a reflection of
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>life’s harmony. The world turned to crystal. To stay alive !
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>must move in the direction I saw by tracing out patterns
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>made by the feel. The Waterpeople took me home and
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>one by one all burned out. Susan was first. She had held
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the flame of their loving. They gave me a home that was
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>free for the living and she felt its foundation rest on her
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>back. Felt she couldn’t touch me or the rest of her would
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>all drain away. Pain, shattered crystal, let me know l was
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>broken. 1 must look for the light in fragments I found.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>Alone in that big house—a child’s distance from my
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>five parents as I watched them go to work. Staying home
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>—misbehaving—not going off to school. The hospital&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>physical therapy—I should go to try. But trying meant to
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>hurt on purpose, with pain I could stop. I wouldn’t do it,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>distressed my friends and made them pull away. Every
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>time they looked for progress, they saw me looking back.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>The hospital held such pain; I knew it to be the mouth
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>of the trap. Packed with illusions and spewing out dam
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>age, housing the doctor who worked on my head. I be
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>lieved him when he said he knew nothing to heal me. Like
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>a leaf in the wind, my touching was fragile. Live by
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>death’s door and I mustn’t scream. Half of my brain lay
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>crushed on the highway. Now was the time to attend a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>new birth. Going toward good feeling moved me out in
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>new spaces, leaving my mother, joining my friends. Brand
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>new child, filled with wonder, turning from death&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>invitation because something else called. If survival didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>feel good, that meant I would die. My left arm answered
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>and swept through the air. I watched with the others as
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the energy made my arm dance. Everyone had an opinion
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>— as if down in the cellar i’d found a strange bird. It
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>danced to the left, just where I wasn’t watching. There
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>was a crack to the left where things would fall out. A
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>place of surprises, a hole in the world. My arm moved
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>through space only others could see. Enough to feel its
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>lovely motion weaving round the crack. Left arm sews the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>world together when 1 let it dance.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>To be able to feel it, there was one cardinal rule. Lying
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>was out. It made two things out of one. I could only see,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>hear, think one thing at a time. Lies confused me, they
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>tasted of death. But not to lie meant I must say it out
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>loud. Any idea that started to harden, 1 would set free for
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>the sake of space in my mind. Each moment carried its
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>own comfort— all 1 had to do was attend. Throw out the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>rocks I found in my bedding and trust to the softness my
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>dancing arm made —light forming spirals just off to the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Out of time, yesterday had left me here. Constant
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>inner tremble so l couldn’t walk. Learn the speed of an
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>infant&apos;s run when life’s an endless day. So trusting con
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>nections, 1 danced with my friends. A moon to the orbits
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>saw their lives make. They talked to me from some other
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>planet. They’d come play for a while and then they would
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>leave — to worlds more important than passing the
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>moments. Cursed now to live on the edge of their lives.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Strangers I met seemed cut loose from fairy tales — come
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>to show me the space l was in.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>Events seemed to happen in some kind of order, laying
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>a trail to find my way home. First New York to visit a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>friend in the making. I met Diana before I was hurt and
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>we’d talked much of death. This visit to her was a part of
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>the pattern. A point on the Continuum, next thread in the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>weaving. Almost a stranger—she took on that dimension
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>the moment she suggested I color my hair.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>Henna. It was a strange bottle I found on her shelf.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Egyptian mud, good for the head. We both got excited at
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>the thought of it red. But back in St. Louis, it was just
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>another sign of my strangeness.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>With my red hair 1 went off to a conference on Radical
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Therapy. Friends were driving, but 1 flew ahead. Exhilarat
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>ing to be on my own, to have no one meet me to act as a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>shield. Strangers there would not know about damage.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Thoughts of finding someone like me
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>At the Grand Hotel in lowa City, I followed the instruc
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>tions of the brochure. It said we’d be picked up at eight
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>o’clock. Color and balance came in with the roses. They
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>made three hours waiting seem one long rich moment.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>Just before eight, hunger sent me to the dining room for a
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>&quot;sandwich to go.” A woman in the room stood up and
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>waved. After checking out she meant me, 1 walked over
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>and she asked me to sit down. A mysterious stranger—the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>feel of the Goddess, come in disguise. I felt a magical pull
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>and then thought—mistake. She was such a drag and kept
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>calling me &quot;kid.&quot; Just another pigeon with the message
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>—go home. She asked my direction and found I didn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>know it. Said that those radicals would eat off my head.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>Don’t go, please to stay with her for the night. Go back in
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>the morning to all those who loved me—and learn to have
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>caution before the next flight.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>really regretted my impulse to join her. 1 left her at
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>table and went to the lobby to find the right ride. But the
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>lady came up and pulled on my sleeve. Dón’t do it, kid.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Her mouth was tight. Something will happen, 1 just feel
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>like l know. This was the time to pull my trump card
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>wanting to take the words from her mouth. A few months
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>ago, 1 almost died, I said. I want to keep living until
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>there’s no choice. I know about death, she said, holding
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>up a two fingered hand. 1 have a strange disease you’ve
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>never heard of. My whole body is turning to stone. The air
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>in the room hushed for a moment. Still as a window to
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>some other world. Contact with Stonelady had shown me
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>the stakes of my choices. Went off to the conference with
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>no need for roots. Passing up drama, 1 went to the kitchen
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>and found chopping onions a most profound act. Life is so
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>easy among your own kind.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>So many ways to heal. Into the season of acts of faith,
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Istarted my own practice again. Thought to take up
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>where 1 had left off. Annie was shocked when she saw my
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>red hair—she remembered a dream full of fear. While
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>lay in a coma, she dreamed of a visit. Down to the hos
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>pital, a big, empty room—a screen with a picture of me.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>had bright red hair.
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>Helping to heal, we talked on new levels. She made me
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>be honest with all that 1 knew. Annie spoke of her friend
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>who was dying of cancer—same side of the brain. Annie
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>carried our stories until he asked that we meet. It felt like
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>a summons, contrary to choice. I feel like l’ve known you
				<lb facs='#facs_103_r_2_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>for all of my life, Tom said softly, just after we’d come.I
			</p>
			<pb n='104'/>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>could only stand and nod but we both felt the pull.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Another who knows the left side dying. Said that some
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>day l’d come back for a visit. That night, I knew it was
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>time.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>But l had no last name or room number and Annie&apos;s
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>line was still busy. When I reached her she told me, he
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>was leaving the next day. His parents were taking him
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>home to die. We went back to the hospital next morning
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>at dawn, pulled by a power, a trust beyond reason. Where
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>were you, asked Tom. Last night was so awful. Theyre all
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>crazy animals. I wanted you to come and you didn’t. I
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>couldn’t get here by myself but 1 heard you call. We
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>shared his breakfeast for feelings that gave us. All know
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>ing the pleasure of taking what&apos;s good. It’s so important to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>see all the leaving. Don’t let them hide the knowing from
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>you. To see clearly you’ll have to look through your pain.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>It gets so beautiful when you admit what is real. To die is
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>no sadder than anything else. When I stood to leave,
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>knew we had met. Instead ot goodbye he gave me his hat
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>A bright orange knit hat had covered his shaven head
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>The feel of a helmet, protection—like in henna’s jar. As
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>long as l wore it, my head would be safe. Events kept
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>stringing together. Someone had thought my hair should
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>be red. A current of thought, a force that was larger. Who
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>do you think was messing around with my head? Witches
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>are known for their red hair all over the world. It tied in
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>with legends of strangers who came from distant lands,
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>strangers with red hair and blue eyes. There, you see
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>She’s at it again. It’s no wonder I thought my life had been
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>blessed.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Tom sent me a painting. That was important. The
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>painting was framed in the way of my looking. It hung on
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>the wall for when 1 could see. Taking a glance 1 first felt
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>afraid. Somehow, word of my magic hadn’t moved to the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Waterhouse. Susan, at center, was spinning me ’round.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>All l really wanted was for Susan to love me. The fact that
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>she didn’t became a new koan. I couldn’t help wanting
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>her and knew that the wanting was what kept me out. But
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>wanting was feeling, an energy flow. 1 had to want Susan
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>to make my arm dance. New breakthroughs: breaking so
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>much I walked on cut glass. I wanted to leave, according
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>to schedule. Afraid, if I didn’t, I never would. Easy enough
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>to go back to school; a crippled whiz-kid who’s excused
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>half her brain. Clear, to stay here, there’s no happy
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>ending. Go in the direction of my dancing arm.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>On the agenda of dreams made to order, a plan was
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>still held by my mentor. Beautiful lady in worlds full of
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>color. I loved how she sailed such sights from my soul
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>Knowing she loved me, showed I was good. If 1 could join
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>her, then I wasn’t broken. Healers together, keeping alive.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>She’d been the Waterpeople’s credentials. She’d battled
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>my mother and she had won. Guiding me always through
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>a war of decisions, she seemed to know the rules of the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>game. But our lives had gotten twisted around the event.
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>Summer and Mentor packed me off to Milwaukee
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>Lived by the lake in a castle-like house; her lover lived
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>with us and she was the star. I was to build my world onto
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>hers. Take up her practice where she left off. They’d fly
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>away and return for reflection, the heat of their living
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>made my only light. With summer’s passing, my mind
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>turned to crystal. I thought I must freeze not to loose
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>what 1 knew. No ground for my being kept me an object
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>on foreign soil. Left arm hanging down like a clipped
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>wing. 1 left the damn city, the first day of Fall. Take what!
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>knew and trust it to heal me. No way to make the next
			</p>
			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>moment safe. Iso
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>flinging off
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>rules.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>Get up, out of the middle 1 heard a voice call. Stuck in
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>the middle, since 1 could remember. A family, this state,
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>this century. Get by with no boundaries. That’s how to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>survive. Feelings. Magnets to sources whose endings were
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>dead. Be a Good Catholic Girl, or politico or shrink.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Change the answers to questions and follow the flow. The
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>only room 1 felt led out on the highway, drive to New
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>York, no need for a map. Stay in the present or the crack
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>would come open. Things falling out where 1 couldn’t see.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>New York appeared a platform of safety—fly towards
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>outside and land on my feet. New. York was the world!
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>left, inside out. Here to begin, l’d come to the landing. It
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>seemed everyone here had just left the boat.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>But back to St. Louis, prodigal child. A trial was
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>scheduled—on the subject of brain damage. No question
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>of fault —the woman had been on the wrong side of the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>road. All that was left was to determine the extent of the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>damage. Damage or magic? That was my question. The
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>roads of this journey, the truth would unfold. The Past
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>would provide the vision so that 1 could see who lwas.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>Mythmaker, living a part of the tale. Go back to the trial
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>—then travel the country—follow a spiral knotted with
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>dreams. Travel the distance to an old point of view, back
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>to Grandmother who lay in bed dying. Join all the women
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>— over my mother’s head. Whisper to the old women, hei
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>mother’s name. Make me a name to roll off the tongue.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>Mary Martha McGuire, say who l am.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Riding in Goldie, l’d skim the earth, picking up point
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>ers from friends where they lay. Connections l’d made l’d
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>paint on a mural. One rose in the sun, glitter paint for the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>water, moon on the left. Maybe a bird on the back of the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>van, to show that a nest could fly. Filled with junk from
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>all the unmoving, Goldie began this like a good scout. She
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>carried an old chair of my mother’s, dancing with clutter.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>Isaid hold me and show me the vision I need.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>Return to St. Louis but instead of answers — all ques
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>tions. All looking at me. Leaders of living had all gone
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>away. No one to judge the stand that 1 took, no one to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>help me decide. My arm danced for the lawyer when
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>told him the truth. My trial was over, with my questions
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>for answers. Come to find out the planet is me.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>In Goldie there was Pat in Florida, Pat in Mexico, Pat
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>who was the lover of the woman who had given The
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>Comforter to Susan. Pat with me in Texas, where I went to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>see my sister. The threads of the pattern still weaving.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>A member of family at Christmas, work the way back
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>in. This was to be the introduction of magic, the next
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>logical step towards going home. My sister was kind and
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>then angry at damage. When my parents wouldn’t talk to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>me on Christmas, I saw what she meant. I couldn’t move
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>backward and so l leaned forward. Out to find Pat to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>spend The New Year
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>A woman was with her, when 1 arrived at the house.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>Mary, someone l’d already met. Then, she had told mel
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>gave her the creeps. She thought 1 could see through her.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>As for me, that was fine. Sore from the cutting I felt from
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>my family, trying to tie my egg to a knot. They wanted to
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>trip and I decided to do it. Have someone with me, feeling
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>ot home. Went to a house in the country, where Pat knew
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>two women. Down by the river better to follow the light
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>of the day. Mary moved among trees, me trailing after.
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>With me, she felt a pain of her own. Each time I got
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_66' n='N066'/>settled, she told me to move. She seemed to enjoy the
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_67' n='N067'/>role that 1 gave her. Asking for safety and then l was
				<lb facs='#facs_104_r_3_1_tl_68' n='N068'/>hounded. Heard her footsteps and took to the woods.

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>One step at a time, the rhythm was walking. Feet
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>stroking earth’s breast in a dream. Follow the path of my
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>dancing arm. Tripping my brains out, brain-damaged
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>pervert, loose in the woods. Lost in west Texas, Iwalked
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>foreign country. Night started falling and the monster was
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>me. Too strange for Christmas, good Catholic girl, matted
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>to Mother’s nightmare. She slept while she dreamed that!
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>walked it alone. House on the hill had just turned its lights
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>on, thought when ! saw it l’d found the way back. Stuck in
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>fairy tales, l’d lost direction. From this point, home could
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>be anywhere.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>Night had crept in, all the way to the fence. Go to the
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>house, they’Il find out you’re crazy. Strap a machine on
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>you and then you’ll survive. Approaching the door like a
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>penitent sinner. Beaten down cur, held at bay by a dog.A
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>boy turned to woman came out with her friend. She asked
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>me again where I wanted to go. But my mouth couldn’t
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>hold the sounds it should make. Pat’s name for a handle,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>out with a stammer. I breathed when she grabbed it, she
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>knew 1 belonged. Other house in the country—for women
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>out flying. Come into the kitchen and wait for your
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>friends. Pat laughed when she saw me curled up in a
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>chair. Argument ended, the world could be trusted
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>starting with self. But I remembered trees cutting black
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>ness—showing me depths waiting below.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>Before leaving Texas, 1 made a last visit. Passed
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>mother’s chair onto my sister; seat that had told me all
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>that it could. Grandmother lay dying, surrounded by
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>guards. Ileft Texas crying deep in my soul. Driving into
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>New York 1 was doubly careful. Try not to fall off eithei
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>side. Tired standing on the brim, but I mustn’t wander
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Night’s edges are sharp. No one to blame but yourself if
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>you fall. Learn how to be here, out, up, on the ledge.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>One semester of grad school and l’d have credentials.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>Keep rhythm going through system of brakes. Prove
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>could do it—this ledge is by choice. People began to look
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>at me strangely, always, it seemed, l’d dropped from the
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_38' n='N038'/>sky. 1 asked their location and they thought 1 was lost. Bag
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_39' n='N039'/>ladies were comrades in this fading light. So mother was
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>right after all —being alive is too much to ask
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>On a trip to the ocean, I saw it all clearly. When the
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>sun lay gray on the water, 1 knew for a fact. The world
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>hadn’t changed and the pain was in me. A case of terminal
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>blindness—unless help arrived. Pity. Feel for the first time
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>this body’s sorrow. Hurting so long, not making a sound.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>Take it for granted—left has more feeling. Right clenching
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>teeth, old broken jaw. Each cell in my body held in a
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>scream. Make another world for me out of what’s left.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_49' n='N049'/>got something I could touch and see and carry home,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_50' n='N050'/>covered in brown paper.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_51' n='N051'/>You can only see bubbles looking down.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_52' n='N052'/>BURSTING—take a drink.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_53' n='N053'/>Buy a machine. At first, the left side of my body had felt
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_54' n='N054'/>like a balloon. Feeling came back like a mouth out of
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_55' n='N055'/>novocaine. Like hair that’s electric, after the brush
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_56' n='N056'/>My vibrator’s bright orange, same as the hat. Before,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_57' n='N057'/>orgasms had only happened by accident. First lady lover
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_58' n='N058'/>had brought them to me. I squirted with laughter, to find
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>such release. Liquid feeling, 1 could hardly stand. Frozen
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_60' n='N060'/>rod-like again, afraid of shattered glass. Seduce battered
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_61' n='N061'/>body, down to the feet.
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>Inside had to see what outside was doing. Strange to
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>be meeting now. Before the accident l’d found comfort
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_64' n='N064'/>looking—gazing into the mirror till I liked myself. A
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_1_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>method of greeting, across foreign lands. To go further,

			<p>
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>needed some outside validation. Odds were just fair,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>being broken, this would bring me to heal. Diana men
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>tioned an article she’d read. The true myth of Narcissus,
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>knew that was me. Ovid wrote the myth in Metamorphosis
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>— an old story, since distorted by the insurgents. But the

				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>not if he never &quot;loved&quot; himself. Narcissus went to the

				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>and heard something melt with the knowing. The image is

				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>therapy and rented her eyes.

				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>over to match up the feelings. Each hand was holding
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>what the other side knew. Tom’s painting cleared to an

				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>My therapist said at meeting that she was surprised at
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>my chronological age. Color and light had gone out of my
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>world. It showed on my face —1 had tasted defeat. Pain
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>turned to anger and on its way out let me know l’d been
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>screwed. All of the pieces were flying together. Coming so
				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>fast, they made my eyes spin. I went in from the ledge:

				<lb facs='#facs_105_r_2_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>Now, think over what l’m saying. There may be a way

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>environment. The secret societies of these cultures are
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>responsible for teaching social values and celebrating the
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>rites of passage. In effect, they are the perpetuators of
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>traditional codes. Among the Mende, Vai, Temne and
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>Sherbro tribes of Sierra Leone and Liberia, there are two
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>important secret societies: the Poro for men and the
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>Bundu for women.
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>It was through their art that 1 first learned about the

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>lives of the women in this tribal society? How do they
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>establish sexual identities and define the status of women
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>in short, how do they perpetuate a stable social order?
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>The Bundu is the only masked secret society of women
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>in all of Africa. It functions within what appears to be a
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>male-oriented culture concurrent with the Poro to main
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>tain a balanced social order. Through the mask, Bundu
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>women obtain power beyond that granted for merely
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>domestic functions. They may hold public office, even
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>that of Paramount Chief, and they are influential in gov

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>The Bundu, like other female secret societies, prepares

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>bers of the Poro. This knowledge enables them tofunction

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>cestors is vital. They are the intermediaries between the

				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>chooses. However, initiation rites of female adolescents
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>usually occur at the beginning of menstruation or preg
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>nancy, at which time the initiates are taught by those who
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>are informed or experienced.? Moreover, the extended
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>Bundu training engenders both independence and a
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>strong sense of sisterhood by permitting girls to loosen
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>ties with their mothers at the same time that they make
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>new ties with other adult women of the community.
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>The initiatory sessions are announced by means of a
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>circular sent around in the form of a small piece of sokolo,
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>tobacco. Fees, money, cloth or other commodities are
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>due at this time. The number of initiates depends on both
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>local support and available teachers. Usually the enroll
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>ment is not more than thirty.
				<lb facs='#facs_108_r_6_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>The first event of the initiation tests the girl’s commit

				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>familiar with the rituals and symbols of the society and
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>tells him the name of the ancestor for her mask; he then
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>secludes himself in the bush to visualize the spirit that will

				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>cord with the tradition of strict division of labor.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>However, the mask provides a perspective on the
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>initiated woman’s power. It is during the masked ritual,
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>private and public, that the Bundu appear so formidable.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>They surround themselves with the exotic, the mysterious,
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>and the grotesque. This aura is confirmed by the visible
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>and invisible accoutrements of masks, costumes, dances
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>and sounds—or silence and secrecy. With all of these
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>means, the Bundu invokes the Goddess of the Mask, who
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>is called Sowei.° Sowei is the personification of all those
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>aspects of the ideal and powerful associated with Earth
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>Mother and Queen. She is clearly a cult object to be wor
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>shipped and revered by men and women. The iconog
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>raphy of the mask is material and sensual, which furthen
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>reflects this ideal.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>The mask illustrated here is from the Sherbro Islands,
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>off the coast of Sierra Leone in West Africa. The basic
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>form of the mask, and others of its kind, is a bell shape or
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>helmet. The most prominent feature is the bulging ringed
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>neck, which suggests wealth, fertility and beauty.” This
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>aspect expresses the Mende equation of corpulence with
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>fertility and is reminiscent of Goddesses and female icons.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>The forehead and cheeks are protruding and round, also
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>implying corpulence. Erich Neumann, in his book The
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>Creat Mother, writes: “One means by which early man

				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>elementary character””° (suggesting her fertility).
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_41' n='N041'/>The slit eyes and closed mouth symbolize the fact that
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>the Bundu spirit never speaks. Her silence is equated with
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_43' n='N043'/>power and judgment. When she wishes to communicate,
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>she does so through one of the lower members of the
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>Bundu, a Ligba.
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_46' n='N046'/>The elaborate braided pattern of the hair indicates the
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_47' n='N047'/>importance placed on this feature. Emblematically, hair is
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_48' n='N048'/>power. The braid may be interpreted in the same mannen

				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_59' n='N059'/>Horns are also tied around the neck or waist of children to

				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_62' n='N062'/>and have access to its powers to protect themselves from
				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_63' n='N063'/>known and unknown spirits. The adopted object or animal

				<lb facs='#facs_109_r_4_1_tl_65' n='N065'/>On top of the mask is a bird perched on a cup. One

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>We are mulier and homo sapiens; our species has
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>undergone a long process of differentiation in which the

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>ed. But now is the time for the re-emergence of the
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>feminine and feminine values, which include reverence
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>for the physical body, as well as for the planetary body we
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>inhabit. This is an attitude of participation instead of
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>control. For me, moving toward the feminine, toward a
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>spirituality which is grounded in (my) female experience,
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>has been a process of allowing a greater receptivity to the
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>unfolding present.
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>Three— Invocation

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_32' n='N032'/>Let this writing be a ritual of mourning. To mourn is
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_33' n='N033'/>connected to the Sanskrit and Avestan words meaning to
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>feel sorrow, lament, but also to remember. I am passing
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>through a time of mourning, of purgatory. Purgatory is the
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_36' n='N036'/>midpoint between death and rebirth. It is the place of
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_37' n='N037'/>making atonement. Atonement: reconciliation, comple

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_40' n='N040'/>attempts to change.

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_42' n='N042'/>Feminism begins in the self-consciousness of female

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_44' n='N044'/>earliest perceptions and feelings. I am not aware of any
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_2_1_tl_45' n='N045'/>sense of restriction because of my sex before I was five

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>and learning to cook. I have a few dolls, mostly given by
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>my grandmother. I sew clothes for one or two of them,
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>but mainly the dolls stay on the closet shelf. Rather than
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>cooking and preparing food, 1 prefer the task of “official
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>taster” of the food my mother prepares. My father makes

				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>them. This continues for a couple of years, until gradually
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>my relationship with one of them changes. I am kissed for
				<lb facs='#facs_120_r_3_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>the first time, and I turn my lips away.

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>my body as possible.
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>Externally, the pregnancy goes very smoothly. I move
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>out of the dormitory at five and a half months, when few
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>people know that 1 am going to have a baby. I move into a
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>rooming house across the street from the hospital, and
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_9' n='N009'/>live there for three months. 1 eat well and lightly, like to
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_10' n='N010'/>sleep and draw and listen to music. I continue with
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_11' n='N011'/>school. The boy-child is born a month premature, and my
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_12' n='N012'/>labor is long and difficult. I want to die. He goes home
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>with adopted parents. I walk out with a friend’s assistance
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>after paying a fifty-cent fee.
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>The strain and trauma, the sense of failure and help
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>lessness in relation to my body, cannot be captured. The

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_18' n='N018'/>than the pregnancy. A school psychiatrist advises me to
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_19' n='N019'/>&quot;stick it out,&quot; to stay in school for finals. This is the
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_20' n='N020'/>second quarter of my first year in college. I know that
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_21' n='N021'/>cannot continue as though nothing has happened. My
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_22' n='N022'/>acute sense of loss and emptiness demands retreat and
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>rest. During the pregnancy l’d continued to live fairly
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>&quot;normally, going to classes, taking tests, socializing, but
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>mainly being alone. After the delivery I need comfort and

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>though I refused to marry him and have the baby. He is

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_29' n='N029'/>after the delivery are strained. The time is painful, and our
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_30' n='N030'/>relationship ends when he goes to Denver.
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_31' n='N031'/>Now that the pregnancy is over 1 begin a long process

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_34' n='N034'/>in body therapy and practicing yoga. Living in my body
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_2_1_tl_35' n='N035'/>becomes increasingly important. After I stop using birth

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_13' n='N013'/>when the delivery was over, but my second pregnancy

				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>willing to wait, to see what is emerging, is the essence of
				<lb facs='#facs_121_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>the feminine in me, and may also be the meaning of my

				<lb facs='#facs_122_r_4_1_tl_7' n='N007'/>women. In this form, it was a ritual which men were not

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_1' n='N001'/>After these many years of digging about in the
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_2' n='N002'/>records of the ancient past, it recently occurred to
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_3' n='N003'/>me that by accepting and continually confirming the
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_4' n='N004'/>idea that we are living in the year 1978 (though we
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_5' n='N005'/>take it so for granted), we might well be inherently
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_6' n='N006'/>limiting our chronological perceptions and thus our

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_8' n='N008'/>part of the past. I wondered—if I began to date my

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_14' n='N014'/>does this have to do with the Great Goddess? Let me
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_15' n='N015'/>explain.
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_16' n='N016'/>Having grown progressively more aware of the
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_17' n='N017'/>subtle but insidious effects of sexist language and

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_23' n='N023'/>By accepting the idea that this is the year 1978, it
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_24' n='N024'/>seems to me that our overall view of the evolution of
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>human development is being affected in a most
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>basic yet unquestioned manner. In fact, I suggest
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_27' n='N027'/>that this acceptance actually perverts and distorts
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_3_1_tl_28' n='N028'/>our perception of the continuity and transitional

				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_4_1_tl_25' n='N025'/>made possible by the underlying permission granted
				<lb facs='#facs_126_r_4_1_tl_26' n='N026'/>by the hotly contested theory of evolution as pre
